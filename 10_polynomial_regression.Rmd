This chapter will cover two widely-used techniques for addressing violations of the assumption of linearity: 

* Polynomial regression, which means raising $X$-variables to a power (e.g., $X^2$ and $X^3$), and 
* Piecewise or segmented regression, which involves using different regression lines over different ranges of a predictor. 

These techniques involves transforming the $X$-variable(s), which can be done in addition to (or instead of) transforming the $Y$ variable. 

Both polynomial and piecewise regression are very useful in practice and lead to advanced topics like splines and semi-parametric regression. They also turn out to be special cases of interactions, so we have already covered a lot of the technical details in Chapter \@ref(chapter-6) -- phew! 


## Polynomial regression {#polynomial-10}

```{r, echo=FALSE, results='asis'}
codefolder::bookdown(init = "hide", style = button)
```

Polynomial regression means that we regress $Y$ on a polynomial function of $X$:

\[ \widehat Y = b_0 + b_1 X + b_2 X^2 + b_3 X^3 + ....\]

Your first thought might be, "doesn’t this contradict the assumption that regression is linear?" The answer here is a bit subtle. 

As with regular linear regression, the polynomial model is linear in the coefficients -- we don’t raise the regression coefficients to a power (e.g., $b_1^2$), or multiply coefficients together (e.g, $b_1 \times b_2$). This is the technical sense in which polynomial regression is still just linear regression, despite its name. 

Polynomial regression does use nonlinear functions of the predictor(s), but the model is agnostic to what you do with your data. The situation here is a lot like when we worked with interactions in Chapter \@ref(chapter-6). In order to model interactions, we computed the product of two predictors and entered the product into the model as a third predictor. Well, $X^2$ is the product of a predictor with itself, so, in this sense, the quadratic term in a polynomial regression is just a special case of an interaction between two variables. 

Although we did not cover interactions among more than two variables in this course, they are computed in the same way -- e.g., a "three-way" interaction is just the product of 3 predictors. Similarly, $X^3$ is just the three-fold product of a variable with itself. 

While polynomial regression is formally similar to interactions, it is used for a different purpose. Interactions address how the relationship between two variables changes as a function of a third. Their inclusion in a model is usually motivated by a specific research question that is formulated before doing the data analysis (see Chapter \@ref(chapter-6)). 

By contrast, polynomial regression is used to address a non-linear relationship between $Y$ and $X$, and is usually motivated by a preliminary examination of data that indicates the presence of such a relationship (e.g., a scatter plot of $Y$ versus $X$; a residual versus fitted plot). While it is possible to formulate research questions about polynomial terms in a regression model, this is not necessarily or even usually the case when polynomial regression is used -- often its just used to address violations of the linearity assumption. 

### Recap of polynomials

In general, a polynomial of degree $n$ (i.e., highest power of $n$) produces a curve that can have up to $n-1$ bends (minima and maxima). Some examples are illustrated in Figure \@ref(fig:poly) below.

* The (orange) linear function of $X$ is a polynomial of degree 1 and has zero bends.
* The (green) quadratic function of $X$ is a polynomial of degree 2 and has 1 bend (a minimum at $X = 0$; this is also called a parabola).
* etc.

```{r, poly, echo = F, fig.cap = "Examples of Polynomials", fig.align = 'center'}
knitr::include_graphics("images/poly.png", dpi = 150)
```

As we can see, this is a very flexible approach to capturing non-linear relationships between two variables. In fact, it can be too flexible!

### Polynomials and curve fitting

Figure \@ref(fig:overfit) shows three different regression models fitted to the same bivariate data. 

* In the left panel, a standard linear regression model is used, and we can see that the model does not capture the nonlinear (quadratic) trend in the data. 

* The middle panel uses a quadratic model (i.e., includes $X^2$ as a predictor, as well as $X$), and fits the data quite well. 

* The right panel uses a 16-degree polynomial to fit the data. We can see that is has a higher R-squared than the quadratic model. But there is also something fishy about this model, don't you agree? 

**Before moving on please take a moment to write down your intuitions about what is going in the right-hand panel of Figure \@ref(fig:overfit) and whether this model really is better than the one in the middle panel. I will ask you to share your thoughts in class.**

```{r, overfit, echo = F, fig.cap = "Polynomial Regression Examples", fig.align = 'center', fig.width = 12}
# Generate data
set.seed(1)
X <- sort(runif(20, -2, 2))
e <- rnorm(20, 0, .5)
Y <- 2 + X - X^2 + e

# Three regression models
mod1 <- lm(Y ~ X)
mod2 <- lm(Y ~ poly(X, 2))
mod3 <- lm(Y ~ poly(X, 16))

# Plots
par(mfrow = c(1, 3)) 

title1 <- paste0("R-squared = ", round(summary(mod1)$r.square, 3))
plot(X, Y, col = "#4B9CD3", pch = 10, lwd = 5, main = title1)
points(X, fitted(mod1), col = 1, type = "l", lwd = 2)

title2 <- paste0("R-squared = ", round(summary(mod2)$r.square, 3))
plot(X, Y, col = "#4B9CD3", pch = 10, lwd = 5, main = title2)
points(X, fitted(mod2), col = 2, type = "l", lwd = 2)

title3 <- paste0("R-squared = ", round(summary(mod3)$r.square, 3))
plot(X, Y, col = "#4B9CD3", pch = 10, lwd = 5, main = title3)
points(X, fitted(mod3), col = 3, type = "l", lwd = 2)
```

To help formulate your intuitions, you might find it useful to consider the plots below. In these plots, a second sample was drawn from the same population, and the regression lines from Figure \@ref(fig:overfit) were added to the plots. Note that the regression parameters were not re-estimated using the second data set. The model parameters from the first data set were used to produce the regression lines for the second data set. 

```{r, overfit2, echo = F, fig.cap = "Polynomial Regression Examples (With New Data)", fig.align = 'center', fig.width = 12}
# Generate data
set.seed(4)
e <- rnorm(20, 0, .5)
Y1 <- 2 + X - X^2 + e

# Three R-squared values
R.squared1 <- 1 - sum((Y1 - fitted(mod1))^2) / var(Y1) / 19
R.squared2 <- 1 - sum((Y1 - fitted(mod2))^2) / var(Y1) / 19
R.squared3 <- 1 - sum((Y1 - fitted(mod3))^2) / var(Y1) / 19
# Plots

par(mfrow = c(1, 3)) 
title1 <- paste0("R-squared = ", round(R.squared1, 3))
plot(X, Y1, col = "#4B9CD3", pch = 10, lwd = 5, main = title1)
points(X, fitted(mod1), col = 1, type = "l", lwd = 2)

title2 <- paste0("R-squared = ", round(R.squared2, 3))
plot(X, Y1, col = "#4B9CD3", pch = 10, lwd = 5, main = title2)
points(X, fitted(mod2), col = 2, type = "l", lwd = 2)

title3 <- paste0("R-squared = ", round(R.squared3, 3))
plot(X, Y1, col = "#4B9CD3", pch = 10, lwd = 5, main = title3)
points(X, fitted(mod3), col = 3, type = "l", lwd = 2)
```
### Interpreting the model

As mentioned, polynomial terms are often added into a model as a way to address nonlinearity. When this is the case, the polynomial terms themselves are not of much substantive interest, and are just added to "patch up" the model after assumption checking. 

We saw an example of this in Section \@ref(worked-example-7). In that example, linear term and quadratic terms for SES were entered into the model in the same block. The R-squared was interpreted for the entire block, but the interpretation of the regression coefficient for the quadratic term was not addressed. This is a pretty common way of using polynomial regression -- the polynomial terms are included so that the model assumptions (linearity) are met, but they are not necessarily interpreted beyond this.  

However, we can interpret the terms in a polynomial regression if we want to. This section addresses the interpretation of a quadratic regression, but a similar approach applies to models with higher-order terms. 

Let's consider a classic example of a quadratic relationship: the Yerkes-Dodson law relating physiological arousal (i.e., stress) to task performance, represented in Figure \@ref(fig:YD). One way to interpret the law is in terms of the overall shape of the relationship. As stress goes up, so does performance -- but only up to a point, after which more stress leads to a deterioration in performance. 

```{r, YD, echo = F, fig.cap = "Yerkes-Dodson Law (Source: Wikipedia)", fig.align = 'center'}
knitr::include_graphics("images/YerkesDodson.png", dpi = 75)
```

The Yerkes-Dodson law exemplifies the *basic* interpretation of a quadratic relationship: 

* A U-shaped curve corresponds to a *positive* regression coefficient on $X^2$. 
* An inverted-U-shaped curve corresponds to a *negative* regression coefficient on $X^2$.

Using this interpretation, you should be able to tell whether the Yerkes-Dodson law implies a positive or a negative quadratic relationship between stress and performance (Spoiler: its negative - i.e., the curve is an inverted-U-shape)

Beyond the overall shape of the relationship, we might also want to know what level of stress corresponds to the optimal level of performance -- i.e., where the maximum of the curve is. This exemplifies a more complicated interpretation of a quadratic relationship, and it requires some calculus (see Section \@ref(deriviation-10), which is optional). The main result is that for the quadratic regression model

\[ \widehat Y = b_0 +b_1X + b_2X^2, \]

the value of $X$ that corresponds to the maximum (or minumum) of the quadratic curve is

\[ X = \frac{-b_1}{2 b_2} \]

The image above doesn't provide numerical values for the stress variable the Yerkes-Dodson law. So, let's assume the linear term is not statistically significant (i.e., $b_1 = 0$). 

**Based on this discussion, please use the "more complicated" interpretation of a quadratic relationship to describe the Yerkes-Dodson Law.** 

### Derivation* {#deriviation-10}

Recall from calculus that the extrema (i.e., minima and maxima) of a function occur when the derivative of the function is equal to zero. The derivative of the quadratic regression equation is
$$
\frac{d}{dX} \hat Y = \frac{d}{dX} (b_0 + b_1X + b_2X^2) = b_1 + 2b_2X.
$$

Setting the derivative to zero
$$
b_1 + 2b_2X = 0
$$

and solving for $X$ 

$$ X = -\frac{b_1}{2b_2} $$
gives the value of $X$ at which the $\hat Y$ reaches its minimum or maximum value. 

### Model building

Up to this point we have discussed the interpretation of polynomials. Now we consider how to build polynomial regression models in practice. A typical model-building process for polynomial regression might proceed as follows. 

1. Enter the linear terms into the model and then examine a residual versus fitted plot. 

2. If there is evidence of non-linearity, look at the scatter plots between the outcome variable and each individual predictor to sort out which predictors are potentially causing the non-linearity. 

3. Add a quadratic term for a predictor of interest and examine whether there is a statistically significant increase in R-squared (See Section \@ref(delta-rsquared-7)). If it is, re-check the residual versus fitted plot to see whether the linearity assumption is still problematic. If it isn't, the quadratic term is not improving the model fit, so remove it from the model and try again. 

4. Keep adding polynomial terms one at a time until the model assumptions looks reasonable.  

This overall approach is illustrated in the next section. However, there are a couple of important details to point out first. 


* Just like with interactions, higher-order polynomial terms are often highly correlated with lower-order terms (e.g., $X$ and $X^2$ will be highly correlated if $X$ takes on strictly positive values). Recall that if two predictors are highly correlated, this can affect their regression coefficients (see Section \@ref(ols-4)) as well as their standard errors (see Section \@ref(too-many-predictors-7)). There are few things that can be done about this. 

    * Interpret $\Delta R^2$ values rather than the individual regression coefficients. This is the easiest thing to do. 
    * Center the predictors before computing higher order terms. This is the same approach we discussed for interactions (Section \@ref(binary-continuous-interaction-6)).
    * Use "orthogonal polynomials" which ensure the different polynomial terms are uncorrelated. This is the default approach in `R`, but it definitely leans more towards curve-fitting than substantive interpretations of the polynomial terms.


* We can't conclude that there is a quadratic relationship between two variables unless we have controlled for their linear relationship. As we just discussed, higher-order terms can be highly correlated with lower-order terms. Thus, higher-order terms will reflect their specific degree of curvature (e.g., quadratic) only if all lower-order (e.g., linear) terms are included in the model as well. In practice, this means that all lower-order terms should be included in the model in order for the higher-order terms to have a clear interpretation. 

* Finally, a warning: Making good use of polynomial regression requires walking a fine line between curve fitting and theory based modeling (see Figure \@ref(fig:overfit)). Sometimes, adding polynomial terms can provide an elegant and intuitive interpretation of the relationship between two variables. But, if you find yourself adding more than a couple of polynomial terms into a model and still have unresolved issues with nonlinearity, it is probably best to consider another approach (such as piece-wise regression, see Section \@ref(piecewise-10)) 

## A worked example {#worked-example-10}

```{r, echo=FALSE, results='asis'}
codefolder::bookdown(init = "hide", style = button)
```

In Section \@ref(worked-example-9) we saw that applying a log-transform to the `Wages.Rdata` example addressed non-normality of the residuals but did not do much to address nonlinearity. The diagnostic plots for the log-linear regression of wages on education are presented below.    

```{r}
# Load the data and take a look
load("Wages.RData")
attach(wages)

# Create log transform of wage
log_wage <- log(wage + 1)

# Regress it on educ
mod1 <- lm(log_wage ~ educ)

# Check out model fit
par(mfrow = c(1,2))
plot(educ, log_wage, col = "#4B9CD3")
abline(mod1)
plot(mod1, 1, col = "#4B9CD3")
detach(wages)
```

Because there is one prominent bend in our residual vs fitted plot of the log-linear model (at $\hat Y \approx 2.1$), let's see if adding a quadratic term to the model can improve the model fit. 

The `poly` function in `R` makes it  easy to do polynomial regression, without having to hard-code new variables like `educ^2` into our dataset. This function automatically uses orthogonal (uncorrelated) polynomials, so we don't have to worry about centering, either. The basic interpretation of the model coefficients in an orthogonal polynomial regression is the same as discussed in Section \@ref(polynomial-10), but the "more complicated" interpretation of the model parameters is not straightforward. To find out more, use `help(poly)`.

The diagnostic plots for the log-linear model with a quadratic term included for education is shown below, along with the model summary. In the output, `poly(educ, 2)n` is the $n$-th degree term in the polynomial. 

```{r}
attach(wages)
mod2 <- lm(log_wage ~ poly(educ, 2))
par(mfrow = c(1,2))
plot(educ, log_wage, col = "#4B9CD3")

# To plot the trend we need to we first need to order the data and the predicted values ... 
sort_educ <- educ[order(educ)]
sort_fitted<- fitted(mod2)[order(educ)]
points(sort_educ, sort_fitted, type = "l")
plot(mod2, 1, col = "#4B9CD3")
summary(mod2)
detach(wages)
```

**What is your interpretation of the log-linear model with the quadratic term for education included? Does this address the non-linear relationship observed in the log-linear model? What would you do next? For your reference, the model with a cubic term for education is reported below.**


```{r}
attach(wages)
mod3 <- lm(log_wage ~ poly(educ, 3))
par(mfrow = c(1,2))
plot(educ, log_wage, col = "#4B9CD3")

# To plot the trend we need to we first need to order the data and the predicted values ... 
sort_educ <- educ[order(educ)]
sort_fitted<- fitted(mod3)[order(educ)]
points(sort_educ, sort_fitted, type = "l")
plot(mod3, 1, col = "#4B9CD3")
summary(mod3)
detach(wages)
```

## Piecewise regression {#piecewise-10}

```{r, echo=FALSE, results='asis'}
codefolder::bookdown(init = "hide", style = button)
```

Piecewise or segmented regression is another approach to dealing with nonlinearity. Like polynomial regression, it is  mathematically similar to interaction. Also like polynomial regression, it has a special interpretation and application that makes it practically distinct from interaction. 

In the simplest case, piecewise regression involves interacting a predictor variable with a binary re-coding of itself. To illustrate how the approach works, let’s again consider our wages and education example. The scatter plot of log-wages versus education is presented again below for reference. 

```{r, piecewise1, echo = F, fig.cap = "The Wages Example", fig.align = 'center'}
attach(wages)
plot(educ, log(wage + 1), col = "#4B9CD3")
detach(wages)
```

Consider the following reasoning about the example: 
* For people with 12 or less years of education (i.e., who did not obtain post-secondary education) the apparent relationship with wage is quite weak. This seems plausible, because if a job doesn't require a college degree, education probably isn’t a big factor in determining wages.

* For people with more than 12 years of education, the relationship with wage seems to be stronger. This also seems plausible: for jobs that require post secondary education, more education is usually associated with higher wages. 

* To restate this as an interaction: the relationship between wage and education appears different for people who have a post-secondary education versus those who do not. 

To represent this reasoning visually we can modify Figure \@ref(fig:piecewise1) as shown in Figure \@ref(fig:piecewise2). This captures the basic idea behind piecewise regression -- we have different regression lines over different ranges of the predictor, and the overall regression is piecewise or segmented. 

```{r, piecewise2, echo = F, fig.cap = "The wages example", fig.align = 'center'}
attach(wages)

# Create a dummy variable indicating if education is at least 12 years or more
educ12 <- (educ > 12)*1
# Interact the dummy with educ
mod4 <- lm(log(wage + 1) ~ educ*educ12) 

# Add fitted values to dataset
wages$fitted <- fitted(mod4)

# Sort data on educ
wages <- wages[order(educ), ]

# Plot
plot(educ, log(wage + 1), col = "#4B9CD3")

# Change color for the points with educ ≤ 12
with(subset(wages, educ <= 12), points(educ, log(wage + 1)))

# Plot the predicted values for educ > 12
with(subset(wages, educ > 12), lines(educ, fitted, col = "#4B9CD3"))

# Plot the predicted values for educ ≤ 12
with(subset(wages, educ <= 12), lines(educ, fitted))
detach(wages)
```

### The piecewise model

We have reasoned that the relationship between wages and education might change as depending on whether people have a post-secondary education. We also noted that this sounds a lot like an interaction (because it is!), which is the basic approach we can use to create piecewise models. 

In order to run our piecewise regression, first we need to create a dummy-coded version of education that indicates whether the person had more than 12 years education: 

\[ \text{educ12} = \left\{ \begin{matrix}  
                     1 & \text{if educ } > 12\\ 
                    0 & \text{if educ } \leq 12 
                \end{matrix} \right.
\]

Then, we enter both the dummy-coded indicator and its interaction with `educ` into the model: 

\[ \widehat Y = b_0 + b_1\text{educ} + b_2\text{educ12} + b_3 (\text{educ} \times \text{educ12}) \]

**Please take a moment to work out the interpretation of $b_1$ and $b_3$ in the model above, using the same approach as Section \@ref(binary-continuous-interaction-6). (The interpretation of $b_0$ and $b_2$ is not very interesting but you can work them out too if you like.)**

Note that there are more complex approaches that will search for breakpoints, or can be used to smoothly connect polynomial regressions rather than linear regressions, etc. We won't cover these more complex approaches here, but check out the following resource if you are interested and feel free to ask questions in class: https://rpubs.com/MarkusLoew/12164


### Back to the example

Below is the summary output for the piecewise model, as well as the diagnostic plots. You should be able to come up with a viable interpretation of the model output, based on 

  * What you know about interactions between a binary and continuous variable (Section \@ref(binary-continuous-interaction-6) and above) 
  
  * What you know about the interpretation of regression coefficients in log-linear models (Section \@ref(interpretation-9)) 
  
You can also use the  `emtrends` functions to test the simple slopes (Section \@ref(inference-for-interactions-6)). Note that the intercept and main effect of the binary variable `educ12` are not of much interest in this application. 

**Please take a moment to write down your interpretation of the results, both the diagnostics and the parameter estimates, and be prepared to share your answers in class.**

## Exercises

This section collects the code from Section \@ref(worked-example-10) and Section \@ref(piecewise-10) and your can refer to those sections for more details on interpretation. 

You'll see that some of the plots below require a lot of fiddling about, especially for the piecewise regression model. We will cover some tricks and shortcuts for producing these types plots during the open lab sessions for Assignment 4. So don't worry too much about the complicated-looking coded for the plots at this point! 

Let's start with the "Vanella" log-linear model for the wages examples 

```{r}
# Load the data and take a look
load("Wages.RData")
attach(wages)

# Create log transform of wage
log_wage <- log(wage + 1)

# Regress it on educ
mod1 <- lm(log_wage ~ educ)

# Check out model fit
par(mfrow = c(1,2))
plot(educ, log_wage, col = "#4B9CD3")
abline(mod1)
plot(mod1, 1, col = "#4B9CD3")
```

Because there is one prominent bend in our residual vs fitted plot of the log-linear model (at $\hat Y \approx 2.1$), let's see if adding a quadratic term to the model can improve the model fit. 

The `poly` function in `R` makes it  easy to do polynomial regression, without having to hard-code new variables like `educ^2` into our dataset. This function automatically uses orthogonal (uncorrelated) polynomials, so we don't have to worry about centering, either. The basic interpretation of the model coefficients in an orthogonal polynomial regression is the same as discussed in Section \@ref(polynomial-10), but the "more complicated" interpretation of the model parameters is not straightforward. To find out more, use `help(poly)`.

The diagnostic plots for the log-linear model with a quadratic term included for education is shown below, along with the model summary. In the output, `poly(educ, 2)n` is the $n$-th degree term in the polynomial. 

```{r}
# Regress log_wage on a quadratic function of eduction 
mod2 <- lm(log_wage ~ poly(educ, 2))

# Model output
summary(mod2)

# Diagnostic plots
par(mfrow = c(1,2))

# scatter plot with trend
plot(educ, log_wage, col = "#4B9CD3")
# order the data and the predicted values ... 
sort_educ <- educ[order(educ)]
sort_fitted <- fitted(mod2)[order(educ)]
points(sort_educ, sort_fitted, type = "l")

# residual versus fitted
plot(mod2, 1, col = "#4B9CD3")
```

Using the same approach for the cubic model: 


```{r}
mod3 <- lm(log_wage ~ poly(educ, 3))
summary(mod3)

# Same plots as above, reusing variable names here
par(mfrow = c(1,2))
plot(educ, log_wage, col = "#4B9CD3")
sort_fitted <- fitted(mod3)[order(educ)]
points(sort_educ, sort_fitted, type = "l")
plot(mod3, 1, col = "#4B9CD3")
```

Moving on, let's consider the piecewise model from Section \@ref(piecewise-10)


```{r, fig.cap = "The wages example", fig.align = 'center'}
# Create a dummy variable indicating if education is at least 12 years or more
educ12 <- (educ > 12)*1

# Interact the dummy with educ
mod4 <- lm(log(wage + 1) ~ educ*educ12) 

# The model output
summary(mod4)

# The simple trends
emmeans::emtrends(mod4, specs = "educ12", var = "educ")

# The diagnostic plots
par(mfrow = c(1, 2))
plot(mod4, 1, col = "#4B9CD3")
plot(mod4, 2, col = "#4B9CD3")
```

We can still see some evidence of heteroskedasticity in the residual versus fitted plot, so the last step is to use heteroskedasticity-corrected standard errors to ensure we are making the right conclusions about statistical significance

```{r}
## Make sure the required pacakges are installed
# install.packages("car")
# install.packages("lmtest")

# Step 1. Use "hccm" to get the HC SEs for our piecewise model 
hcse <- car::hccm(mod4)

# Step 2. Use "coeftest" to compute t-tests with the HC SEs
lmtest::coeftest(mod4, hcse)
```

The next bit is optional. It shows how to produce the piecewise regression plot, which takes quite a bit of messing about with R...Let me know if you find an easier way to do this (in base R). 

```{r}
# Building the piecewise regression plot -- yeeesh

# Add fitted values to dataset
wages$fitted <- fitted(mod4)

# Sort data on educ
wages <- wages[order(educ), ]

# Plot
par(mfrow = c(1, 1))
plot(educ, log(wage + 1), col = "#4B9CD3")

# Change color for the points with educ ≤ 12
with(subset(wages, educ <= 12), points(educ, log(wage + 1)))

# Plot the predicted values for educ > 12
with(subset(wages, educ > 12), lines(educ, fitted, col = "#4B9CD3"))

# Plot the predicted values for educ ≤ 12
with(subset(wages, educ <= 12), lines(educ, fitted))
detach(wages)
```

```{r, echo = F}
rm(list = ls())
```
