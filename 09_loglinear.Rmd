In the previous chapter we considered how to check whether the population assumptions of linear regression are problematic for a given data set. In this chapter we discuss one way to deal with assumption violations --  by "transforming" the $Y$ variable. In general, a transformation is just a function we apply to a variable to change it into another variable that we would rather work with. We have already seen some examples of transformations: the z-transformation (z-scores) and percentiles. 

In this chapter we will focus on the use and interpretation of the log-transform, $\log(Y)$, which results in the log-linear regression model. This serves to illustrate the overall approach of transforming the $Y$ variable to address assumption violations, and also leads into a later topic -- logistic regression -- which also involves logarithms. 

Whenever we transform a $Y$ variable in a regression model, it always has three types of consequences. It affects: 

* The distribution of the variable / residuals. 
* The (non-)linearity of its relationship with predictor variables.
* The interpretation of the coefficients the model.  

The big theme of this chapter is that we have to consider all three of these when transforming the $Y$ variable. So, addressing assumption violations using this approach is not always as straightforward as we might hope. In particular, we might find that addressing one problem (e.g., non-normality) can create other  problems (e.g., nonlinearity). 

Another approach for dealing with assumption violations is to transform one or more of the $X$ variables instead of (or in addition to) the $Y$ variable. These approaches are discussed in the next chapter. 

## Math review {#math-review-9}

```{r, echo=FALSE, results='asis'}
codefolder::bookdown(init = "hide", style = button)
```

Before we get into transforming our variables, let's review the requisite math -- logs and exponents. This section uses the lowercase symbols $x$ and $y$ for generic mathematical variables. These symbols do not correspond to the uppercase symbols $X$ and $Y$ in regression notation. So, e.g., $x$ is not a predictor, its just a generic variable. 

The function $\log_{10}(x)$ returns the power to which we need to raise 10 to get the value $x$. It answers the question: $10^? = x$. 

Some examples:

* $\log_{10}(10) = 1$, because $10^1 = 10$
* $\log_{10}(100) = 2$, because $10^2 = 100$
* $\log_{10}(1000) = 3$, because $10^3 = 1000$
* ...

In Figure \@ref(fig:logx) we can see that $\log(x)$ grows much more slowly than $x$. The three values computed above are marked by dashed lines. This is telling us that "big differences" on $x$ translate into "small differences" on $\log(x)$. For every order of magnitude that $x$ increases (e.g., from 10 to 100, or from 100 to 1000), its log only increases by one unit.  

```{r, logx, echo = F, fig.cap = "Log base 10", fig.align = 'center'}
knitr::include_graphics("images/logx.png", dpi = 150)
```

This "compression" of large values down to a smaller scale turns out to be useful for dealing with positive skew, as illustrated in Figure \@ref(fig:logdata). This is one reason that the log transform is widely used.

```{r logdata, echo = F, fig.cap = "Log transform and positive skew", fig.align = 'center'}
# Clean up env. and load data
load("ECLS2577.Rdata")
attach(ecls)

# Plots
par(mfrow = c(1,2))
hist(c1rmscal, col = "#4b9cd3")
hist(log(c1rmscal + 1), col = "#4b9cd3")
```

Now that we have seen the basic interpretation and utility of logs, there are a few details to add. 

### Natural logarithm
The symbol $\log_{10}$ is read "log base 10". In statistics, we almost never use log base 10. Instead we use log base $e$ where $e = 2.7182...$ is called Euler's number. Think of $e$ as a relative of $\pi$ (the ratio of circle's circumference to its diameter). It is an irrational number (i.e., cannot be represented as a ratio) and shows up all over the place. We will see later on that using $\log_e$ makes the interpretation of log-linear regression simpler. Note that in this context, $e$ is not the residual from a regression model -- the interpretation should be clear from context, but just ask a question in class if you are unsure. 

Regardless of which base we use, logs have the same overall compression effect, as shown in Figure \@ref(fig:loge). For example, $\log_{10}(1000) = 3$ and $\log_{e}(1000) \approx 7$ -- both numbers are much smaller than $1000$! The same is true when applied to real data -- in fact, the right hand panel in Figure \@ref(fig:logdata) was computed using $\log_e$. 

```{r, loge, echo = F, fig.cap = "Log base 10 vs log base e", fig.align = 'center'}
knitr::include_graphics("images/loge.png", dpi = 150)
```

Log base $e$, or $\log_e$,  is called the natural logarithm and often denoted "$\ln$". But $\ln$ can be hard to read so we will just stick with $\log$ and omit the base symbol when we mean $\log_e$. This is consistent with what R's `log` function does -- its default base is $e$.

### log and exp

Logarithms have the property that they can always be undone. For example, if we start with the number $x= 100$, we can take the log (base $e$) of that number as above

\[\log(100) =  4.60517 \]

Remember that by definition, this just tells us that $4.60517$ is the power to which we have to raise $e$ in order get $100$, i.e., 

\[e^{4.60517} = 100 \]

Putting these two equations together, we can see that 

\[ e^{\log(100)} = 100. \]

So, taking the log of $100$ gives us $4.60517$, and taking the exponent of $4.60517$ gets us back to the original input, $100$. In general, $e^{\log(x)} = x$. So, exponentiation (i.e., raising something to a power) undoes the logarithm. This undoing is called "inversion" in mathematics.   

From a statistical perspective, the important thing about logs and exponents is that we can always use one to undo the effects of the other. So, if we log transform our $Y$ variable in a regression analysis to make the data more compatible with the model assumptions, we can always undo the log transform afterwards by taking exponents. We will see this trick a lot in what follows -- apply a transform to the data, run the model, then undo the transform to interpret the results. 

A final note about notation. The mathematical symbol $\exp(y)$ is used instead of $e^y$ to avoid having to write complicated expressions in the superscript. The idea is that the left hand side of the following equation is easier to read than the right hand side 

\[ \exp(17 - choclate + banna ) = e^{17 - choclate + banna} \]

### Pop quiz

I'll ask some questions like the following to start class off. **Please write down your answers and be prepared to share them in class**. 

* $\log_2(8) = ?$
* $\exp(2.7182) = ?$
* What is larger, $\log(10)$ or $\exp(10)$? 
* $\log(\exp(x)) = ?$ 


### Rules for log and exp*

There are some rules for working with logs and exponents that we will use later on to derive some results about the interpretation of log-linear regression. You don't need to know these but you might find them useful if you like to follow derivations. 

* Addition with logs":
\[ \log(m) + \log(n) = \log(mn) \] 

* Multiplication with exponents:  
\[\exp(m) \times \exp(n) = \exp(m + n) \] 

## The log-linear model

```{r, echo=FALSE, results='asis'}
codefolder::bookdown(init = "hide", style = button)
```

There are a number of ways to apply logs in regression analysis, which are outlined in the following table and discussed in more detail in the supplemental readings for this week. The focus of this section is log-linear models. Note that the term "log-linear" is also the name of a family of models for contingency table data -- that is not what we are talking about here. 

```{r, log-table, echo = F, fig.cap = "Logs in regression analysis", fig.align = 'center'}
knitr::include_graphics("images/log_table.png")
```

As mentioned, whenever we transform the $Y$ variable we are doing three interrelated things: 

* Changing the distribution Y variable / residuals 
* Changing the (non-)linearity of its relationship with other variables
* Changing interpretation of the regression coefficients

Since log-linear regression is often used to address positive skew in the outcome variable, we will tackle these 3 points in order. However, the last point is perhaps the most important aspect of log-linear regression. 

## Distribution of $\log(Y)$ {#distribution-9}

```{r, echo=FALSE, results='asis'}
codefolder::bookdown(init = "hide", style = button)
```

Below are some examples of the log transform applied to positively skewed data. We can see a range of results, from "wow, that definitely worked" in the first example to, "better but still not great" in the second two examples. These are realistic reflections of how a log transform works to address skew. We will discuss the data used for the third example in more detail in the following subsections, but for now it is sufficient to note that the plots for the third example show the hourly wages of a sample 200 individuals from 1985. 


```{r skew1, echo = F, fig.cap = "Example 1: Log transforming ECLS math", fig.align = 'center', fig.height=8}
par(mfrow = c(2,2))

# histograms 
hist(c1rmscal, col = "#4b9cd3")
hist(log(c1rmscal + 1), col = "#4b9cd3")

# qq plots
qqnorm(c1rmscal, col = "#4b9cd3", main = "qq-plot of c1rmscal" )
qqline(c1rmscal)
qqnorm(log(c1rmscal + 1), col = "#4b9cd3",  main = "qq-plot of log(c1rmscal + 1)" )
qqline(log(c1rmscal + 1))
```

```{r skew2, echo = F, fig.cap = "Example 2: Log transforming ECLS reading", fig.align = 'center', fig.height=8}
par(mfrow = c(2,2))

# histograms
hist(c1rrscal, col = "#4b9cd3")
hist(log(c1rrscal + 1), col = "#4b9cd3")

# qqplots
qqnorm(c1rrscal, col = "#4b9cd3", main = "qq-plot of c1rrscal" )
qqline(c1rrscal)
qqnorm(log(c1rrscal + 1), col = "#4b9cd3",  main = "qq-plot of log(c1rrscal + 1)" )
qqline(log(c1rrscal + 1))
```

```{r skew3, echo = F, fig.cap = "Example 3: Log transforming hourly wages", fig.align = 'center', fig.height=8}
load("Wages.RData")
attach(wages)

# histograms
par(mfrow = c(2,2))
hist(wage, col = "#4b9cd3")
hist(log(wage + 1), col = "#4b9cd3")

# qqplots
qqnorm(wage, col = "#4b9cd3", main = "qq-plot of wage" )
qqline(wage)
qqnorm(log(wage + 1), col = "#4b9cd3",  main = "qq-plot of log(wage + 1)" )
qqline(log(wage + 1))
detach(wages)
```

### Why $\log(x+1)$?
There are a few things to note about this approach to correcting positive skew. First, you might wonder why we are computing $\log(x + 1)$ instead of $\log(x)$. This is because the log function has "weird" behavior for values of $x$ between 0 and 1. These values were not shown in Figures \@ref(fig:logx) and \@ref(fig:loge) where we discussed compression, but they are shown below in Figure \@ref(fig:log0). 

```{r, log0, echo = F, fig.cap = "Logs for small values of X", fig.align = 'center'}
knitr::include_graphics("images/log0.png", dpi = 150)
```

We can see that $\log(1) = 0$, which is true regardless of the base (i.e., $b^0 = 1$ for all choices of the $b$). But for values of $x < 0$, $\log(x)$ goes to negative infinity. This is because of how negative exponents are defined:

\[ b^{-x} = \frac{1}{b^x}. \]

The upshot is that, if your variable takes on values in the range $(0, 1)$, the log transform is going to change those values into large negative numbers. This can result in negative skew, rather fixing your positive skew. 

We can see this in Figure \@ref(fig:skew4) below. The top row of the Figure shows the same variable as Example 1 above (ECLS Math Achievement), and the bottom shows the variable transformed to a proportion. In the left hand panels we can see that the distribution of the proportions is qualitatively the same the as the distribution of the original variable. However, the log transform behaves much differently for these two cases. Why? Because logs are "weird" on the range $(0, 1)$. 

```{r skew4, echo = F, fig.cap = "Comparing Log transforms of ECLS math total score versus proportion correct", fig.align = 'center', fig.height=8}
par(mfrow = c(2,2))
prop_c1rmscal <- (c1rmscal - min(c1rmscal))/100
hist(c1rmscal, col = "#4b9cd3")
hist(log(c1rmscal + 1), col = "#4b9cd3")
hist(prop_c1rmscal, col = "#4b9cd3")
hist(log(prop_c1rmscal), col = "#4b9cd3")
```



To avoid this situation I always add 1 to a variable before taking its log, that what I know that there are no values less than 1 in the data. Technically, there is no reason to do this if the variable does not take on values in the range 0 to 1, but I always apply the "add 1" rule just so I don't have to worry about it. 

### What about negative values of $x$?

You may have noted that the "add 1" rule doesn't cover cases where the variable can take on negative values. And you would be right! The problem here is that there is no way to turn a positive base $b$ into a negative number through exponentiation - i.e., $\log(x)$ is undefined whenever $x < 0$. 

To address situations where you want to log transform a variable that can take on negative values, you can use 

\[ \log(x - \text{min}(x) + 1). \]

The following table shows how this transformation works. The first column shows the original data, the second column shows how subtracting the minimum makes all of the negative numbers positive, and the third column shows how adding 1 makes all of the numbers less than 1 equal to or greater than 1. 

```{r, log-min, echo = F, fig.cap = "Dealing with negative values of x in log transforms", fig.align = 'center'}
knitr::include_graphics("images/log_min.png")
```

The take home message: If we have negative values of $x$, before we apply the log transform we need to: 

* Step 1. “Add” the minimum value of $x$ to prevent undefined values of log
* Step 2. Add 1 to make sure no values are less than 1

Like the "add 1" rule, you can use this procedure all the time, not just when $x$ takes on negative values. 

**Can you think of a log transformation that would work to address data that were negatively skewed, rather than positively skewed? Hint: the trick is similar to the one in this section** 

### Skew versus censoring

It is important to distinguish between skew and floor (or ceiling) effects. Floor and ceiling effects are collectively known as "censoring". While transforming you data can help with skew, it isn't going to do anything about censoring, so it is important to be able to tell the difference. 

Censoring can look like extreme skew, but is importantly different from skew because a large proportion of the observations have exactly the same value. An example is shown in Figure \@ref(fig:floor) below, which shows a floor effect in which a large proportion of the cases have a values of 0 ("are censored at zero"). Note that the log transformation does do not anything about the censored data. In general, if you transform a "heap" of values, then the same heap shows up in the transformed data. 

To deal with censored data, we need to consider alternatives to linear regression (e.g., tobit regression). We won't cover regression for censored data in this course. For our purposes, the moral is: don't mistake censoring for skew, because they don't have the same solution. 

```{r, floor, echo = F, fig.cap = "A floor effect is not the same as positive skew", fig.align = 'center'}
knitr::include_graphics("images/floor_effect.png", dpi = 125)
```

### Final comments on dealing with skew

Recall that the assumptions of linear regression are about the residuals, not about the $Y$ variable itself (see Section \@ref(recap-8)). So, a skewed outcome variable is not necessarily a problem. In particular, it is entirely possible that $Y$ is positively skewed but its residuals are not, especially if one of the $X$ variables has a similar distribution to $Y$. So, don't worry about non-normality of $Y$, its non-normality of the residuals that matters. 

Second, even if the residuals are non-normal, this still doesn't matter very much with very large samples. The central limit theorem assures us that, as the sample size gets larger, the sampling distribution of the regression coefficients converges to a normal distribution, regardless of the distribution of the residuals. This is illustrated in Figure \@ref(fig:clt) below. 

The left panel shows the qq-plot of the residuals when Math Achievement (`c1rmscal`) is regressed on SES (`wksesl`) using the ECLS dataset. The right panel shows the bootstrapped sampling distribution of the regression coefficient, with samples of size $N = 100$. It is apparent that the skewness of the $Y$ variable does not affect the normality of the sampling distribution of the b-weight when the sample size is $100$. This is why we can often ignore skew in $Y$ with “large” samples ($N = 100$ in this case.

```{r, clt, echo = F, fig.cap = "The sampling distribution of a regression coefficient when residuals have positive skew", fig.align = 'center'}
knitr::include_graphics("images/clt.png")
```

The moral of this section is that, if you are considering log transforming an outcome variable due to positive skew, you should keep in mind:

1. The problem may not really need to be fixed: 
    * Check the residuals! 
    * If you have sufficient sample size, mild to moderate violations of normality are not really an issue.

2. The log transformation has other important implications for you model ... 

## Relationship with $X$ {#relationship-9}

```{r, echo=FALSE, results='asis'}
codefolder::bookdown(init = "hide", style = button)
```


In addition to normality, transformations of the $Y$ variable necessarily affect the linearity of regression. In particular, if $Y$ is linearly related to $X$, then $\log(Y)$ cannot also be linearly related to $X$. 

Stated more formally, if

\[ Y = a + bX + \epsilon \] 

then

\begin{align} 
\log(Y) & = \log(a + bX + \epsilon) \\
 & \neq a + bX + \epsilon. \\
\end{align}

What this means in practice is that addressing positive skew using a log transform can sometimes create more problems than it solves. Figure \@ref(fig:nonlinear1) illustrates this situation. In the top row, we see  the residual versus fitted plot and qqplot of residuals for the regression of Math Achievement (`c1rmscal`) on SES (`wksesl`). The linear regression resulted in a clear violation of normality (positive skew). In the bottom row, we see same output after log transforming Math Achievement -- it fixed the issue with normality, but also made the nonlinearity more apparent.  

```{r nonlinear1, echo = F, fig.cap = "Nonlinear vs non-normality when log transforming Y", fig.align = 'center', fig.height=8}
mod1 <- lm(c1rmscal ~ wksesl)
mod2 <- lm(log(c1rmscal + 1) ~ wksesl)
par(mfrow = c(2,2))
plot(mod1, 1)
plot(mod1, 2)
plot(mod2, 1)
plot(mod2, 2)

```

The take home message is that when we transform $Y$ (or $X$) we necessarily affect the relationship between the variables, as well as their individual distributions. It is often the case that when we try to “fix” the normality of the $Y$ variable, we can inadvertently make its relationship to $X$ more non-linear.

Note that the opposite can also happen -- a log transform can make a non-linear (exponential) relationship more linear. The exact result of the transformation depends on the relationships in the original data. 


As we discuss in the next chapter, we can address non-linearity of regression by transforming the $X$ variable(s). But we should be sure that the problem we are trying to solve (normality) isn’t worse than the the problem we end up with (non-linearity). 

**What do you think about the example given in Figure \@ref(fig:nonlinear1)? Is addressing the normality assumption "worth it"? Why or why not?**

## Interpretation {#interpretation-9}

```{r, echo=FALSE, results='asis'}
codefolder::bookdown(init = "hide", style = button)
```

The final point about the log-linear model is how it affects the interpretation of the model parameters. For example, in linear regression we know what a $b$-unit increase in $Y$ means -- but how to we interpret a $b$-unit increase in $\log(Y)$? This is definitely the most important point about the log transformation, which is why we saved it for last. 

In general, one of the main shortcomings of "transforming your data" is that it can lead to uninformative or unclear interpretations of model parameters. If the results don't make sense, its not much of a consolation to know that the assumptions looked OK! 

However, it turns out that there is very nice interpretation of the log-linear model. It is because of this interpretation that we often use the log transform to address skew in $Y$, rather than some other transformation. 

### Approximate interpretation {#approximate-9}

In a log-linear model, the regression coefficients can be interpreted as the *approximate* proportion change in $Y$, in the original units. So, in this equation, 

\[ \log(Y) = a + bX + \epsilon, 
(\#eq:logy)
\]

we can interpret $b$ as the approximate proportion change in $Y$  associated with one unit change in $X$. This should seem surprising. $Y$ is not the outcome variable -- $\log(Y)$ is. But, we can still interpret the model with respect to $Y$! 

It is important to note that this interpretation is approximate and it only applies when $|b| < 1$. When $b$ takes on larger values, we will either need to rescale $X$ or use the exact interpretation in the next section. 

Let's get clear on what proportion change means. For any two values $Y$ and $Y'$, the difference ("change") $Y' - Y$ as a proportion of $Y$ is 

\[ \text{proportion change} = \frac{Y' - Y}{Y} = Y'/Y - 1.\]

Multiplying this by 100 gives us the percentage change. 

For example, if $Y = 100$ and $Y' = 150$ then, 

\[ \text{proportion change} = \frac{150 - 100}{100} = .5, \]

so $Y'$ is 50% *larger* than $Y$. If $Y' = 40$ and $Y = 100$, then $Y'$ is 40% *as large as* $Y$, or, equivalently, 60% smaller than $Y$. 

Here are some more examples. **Please write down your answers and be prepared to share them in class**

* What is the percent increase from $Y = 2$ to $Y' = 6$?  
* What is the percent increase from $Y = 200$ to $Y' = 600$?
* What is the percent decrease from $Y = 600$ to $Y' = 200$?
* What is the percent change from $Y = 1$ to $Y' = 1$?

Now that we know what proportion and percentage change are, let's use these concepts to interpret the regression coefficient in Equation \@ref(eq:logy). Recall that this interpretation is approximate and only applies when $|b| < 1$. 

Some numerical examples: 

* if $b = .25$, then $Y$ is expected to be 25% larger when $X$ increases by 1 unit. 
* if $b = 0$, then $Y$ is expected to be the same when $X$ increases by 1 unit (i.e., no relationship)
* if $b = -.55$, then $Y$ is expected to be 55% as large (45% smaller) when $X$ increases by 1 unit

### A hypothetical example

To get a better idea of how to interpret log-linear regression, let's use a hypothetical example in which we contrast it with linear regression. We will use the followin variables:

* $Y$ is wages (dollars per week) 
* $X$ is hours worked per week

A linear relationship between $Y$ and $X$ would imply

\[ \widehat Y = a + bX. \]

Let's further assume that $b = 20$. With this information, you should be able to work out answers to the following two questions pretty easily: 

1.  For someone who is expected to earn $100/week, what would be their predicted earnings if they worked one hour more per week? 

2.  What about for someone who was expected to earn $1000/week? 

Now let's consider a log-linear model, this time with a regression coefficient of $b = .2$:

\[ \log(\widehat Y) = a + bX. \]

Again, the following questions should be pretty easy: 

3.  For someone who is expected to earn $100/week, what would be their (approximate) predicted earnings if they worked one hour more per week? 

4.  What about for someone who was expected to earn $1000/week? 

The answers to questions 1-4 are hidden below, and you can use the "Show Code" button to see them.

```{r, results = F}
# 1. 120 dollars per week
# 2. 1020 dollars per week
# 3. 120 dollars per week
# 4. 1200 dollars per week
```

This example shows that, while the linear model represents change in fixed units (e.g., dollars), the log-linear model represents change that is proportional to the magnitude of $Y$. This is particularly useful in applications involving monetary outcomes, where it has been argued that people’s "subjective evaluation" of money is more like the latter than the former. 

For example, a \$20 increase in weekly wages means different things to some one who makes \$100/week as opposed to someone who makes 
\$1000/week.

* At \$100/week, \$20 for an additional hour is equivalent to a 20% increase in wages for only a 2.5% (1/40) increase in hours worked.
* At \$1000/week, \$20 is a 2% increase in wages, which is less than the 2.5% increase in hours worked.

On the other hand, a 20% increase for both people might be considered as having “equal subjective value.” 

Some real life examples of this kind of interpretation are linked below.

### Exact interpretation {#exact-9}

The exact interpretation of the regression coefficients in the log-linear model is a bit involved. The main result is 

\[ \frac{\widehat Y(X + 1)}{\widehat Y(X)} = \exp(b) 
(#eq:expb)
\]

where $\widehat Y(X)$ is the predicted value of $Y$ for a given value of $X$. This is result derived in Section \@ref(derivation-9) below (optional).

From Equation \@ref(eq:expb) and the definition of proportion change in the  Section \@ref(approximate-9), it follows that the proportion of change in $\widehat Y$ for a 1 unit increase in $X$ is *exactly* equal to $\exp(b) - 1$. So, if we want an exact interpretation of the regression coefficients in a log-linear model, we need to do some "follow up math". In the hypothetical example above, the exact proportion change in the log-linear model is

\[ \exp(.2) - 1 = 1.2214 - 1= .2214 \]

or about 22%. 

The reason the approximate interpretation in Section \@ref(approximate-9) works is because 

\[ \exp(b) - 1 \approx b \] 

for $|b| < 1$. This is illustrated in the graph below, where the blue line is $\exp(x)-1$ and black line is $x$. We can see that the two lines are pretty close over the range (-1, 1). This is one of the reasons that the natural log is used in the log-linear model, because it makes it easier to get an approximate interpretation the regression coefficients. 

```{r expb, echo = F, fig.cap = "exp(x) - 1 (blue) versus x (black)", fig.align = 'center'}
x <- seq(-3, 3, by = .1)
plot(x, x, type = "l")
points(x, exp(x)-1, type = "l", col = "#4b9cd3", ylab = "y")

### Summary

While there are many transformations that can be used to address skew in the $Y$ variable, the log-linear model has the advantage that it is still interpretable in terms of $Y$. In fact, in many applications, notably those in which $Y$ is monetary, the interpretation is arguably better than for linear regression! 

* The approximate interpretation of the regression coefficients in the log-linear model: a one unit of change in $X$ is expected to yield a $(b \times 100)\%$ change in $Y$. This interpretation only applies with $b$ is small (less than 1 in absolute value).

* The exact interpretation: a one unit of change in $X$ is expected to yield a $((\exp(b) - 1)  \times 100)\%$ change in $Y$, and this applies for any value of $b$. 

### Derivation of Equation \@ref(eq:expb) {#derivation-9}

Start with the log-linear model and then exponentiate both sides:

\begin{align}
\log(\widehat Y) & = a + bX \\
\implies & \\
\exp(\log(\widehat Y)) & = \exp(a + bX) \\
\implies & \\
\widehat Y & = \exp(a)\exp(bX) \\
\end{align}

Then do the same thing for $X+1$ in place of $X$: 

\begin{align}
\log(\widehat Y^*) & = a + b(X + 1) \\
\implies & \\
\widehat Y^*& = \exp(a)\exp(bX)\exp(b) \\
\end{align}

Then take the ratio of $\widehat Y^*$ to $\widehat Y$: 

\[ \frac{\widehat Y^*}{\widehat Y} = \exp(b) \]

## Worked example {#worked-example-9} 

```{r, echo=FALSE, results='asis'}
codefolder::bookdown(init = "hide", style = button)
```

This section works through log-linear regression using the `Wages.Rdata` example data set (source: Weinberg & Abramowitz (2017) Statistics using Stata: An integrative approach. Cambridge University Press). The dataset was collected from 400 individuals in 1985 and contains the following variables.   

```{r}
# Load the data and take a look
load("Wages.RData")
knitr::kable(head(wages))
```

We will focus on regressing hourly wage (`wage`) on years of education (`educ`). The distribution of the outcome variable and its relationship with the predictor are depicted below. 


```{r}
attach(wages)
par(mfrow = c(1,2))
hist(wage,  col = "#4B9CD3")
plot(educ, wage, col = "#4B9CD3")
```

This example is a good candidate for log-linear regression because

* `wages` is positively skewed
* Its relationship with `educ` appears somewhat exponential
* The log-transform provides a suitable interpretation when the outcome is monetary

Moreover, a quick a look at the linear model (below) shows that *all* of the assumptions of the model are violated -- we are going to need to try another approach!

```{r}
mod1 <- lm(wage ~ educ)

# Check out model fit
par(mfrow = c(1,2))
plot(mod1, 1, col = "#4B9CD3")
plot(mod1, 2, col = "#4B9CD3")
```

### Log-linear regression of Wages on Education

To run a log-linear model, we can transform the Y-variable using the `log` function, and then run the model as usual. The diagnostic plots are shown below. 

```{r}
# Create log transform of wage
log_wage <- log(wage + 1)

# Regress it on educ
mod2 <- lm(log_wage ~ educ)

# Check out model fit
par(mfrow = c(1,2))
plot(mod2, 1, col = "#4B9CD3")
plot(mod2, 2, col = "#4B9CD3")
detach(wages)
```

In the qq-plot, we can see that the log transformation helped with positive skew, although didn't do much for the negative tail. It also reduced the apparent heteroskedasticity. However, the relationship still appears non-linear, perhaps more so than in the original linear model. 

Before moving on to address non-linearity in the following chapter, let's make sure we have a good understanding of what the regression coefficients for the log-linear model mean. 

```{r}
summary(mod2)
```

**Please take a moment to write down your interpretation of the regression coefficient for educ in the summary output.**

We can also obtain the transformed model coefficients $\exp(b) - 1$ and their confidence intervals:  

```{r}
conf.b <- cbind(coef(mod2), confint(mod2))
exp.b <- exp(conf.b) - 1
colnames(exp.b)[1] <- c("exp - 1")
exp.b
```
**Please write down your interpretation of the transformed regression coefficient for educ in the output above.**

This section collects the questions asked in this chapter. We will discuss these questions in class. If you haven't written down / thought about the answers to these questions  before class, the lesson will not be very useful for you! So, please engage with each question by writing down one or more answers, asking clarifying questions, posing follow up questions, etc. 


**Section \@ref(math-review-9)**

I'll ask some questions like the following to start class off. Please write down your answers and be prepared to share them in class. 

* $\log_2(8) = ?$
* $\exp(2.7182) = ?$
* What is larger, $\log(10)$ or $\exp(10)$? 
* $\log(\exp(x)) = ?$ 


**Section \@ref(distribution-9)**

* Can you think of a log transformation that would work to address data that were negatively skewed, rather than positively skewed? 

**Section \@ref(relationship-9)**

* What do you think about the example given in the Figure below. Is addressing the normality assumption "worth it"? Why or why not?

```{r, echo = F, fig.cap = "Nonlinear vs non-normality when log transforming Y", fig.align = 'center', fig.height=8}

mod1 <- lm(c1rmscal ~ wksesl)
mod2 <- lm(log(c1rmscal + 1) ~ wksesl)
par(mfrow = c(2,2))
plot(mod1, 1)
