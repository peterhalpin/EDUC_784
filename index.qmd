# Preface {.unnumbered}

These are the course notes for EDUC 784. Readings are assigned *before class.* Sections denoted with an asterisk (\*) are optional. 

The notes contain **questions that are written in bold font**. The questions are also collected in a section called "Workbook" that appears towards the end of each chapter. During class time, we will discuss the Workbook questions, your answers, any additional question you have, etc. It is really important for you to do the readings, and write down your responses to the questions, before class. You won't get much out of the lessons if you haven't done this preparation. 

Some chapters contain a section called "Exercises" that collects all of the R code from that chapter into a single overall workflow. **You don't need to do the Exercises before class**, but you can if you want to. If a chapter doesn't have an Exercises section, that means we will be working on an assignment together instead.
