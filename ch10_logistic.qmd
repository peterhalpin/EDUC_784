# Logistic regression {#sec-chap-10}

The topic we address in this chapter is logistic regression. Like the previous two chapters, logistic regression is an extension of multiple linear regression to situations in which the "standard" model does not directly apply. This time, the extension is to binary *outcome* variables. 

There are many situations in which the outcome of interest can be thought of as a binary or “yes / no” or “true / false” outcome:

* Death (the original logistic outcome; [Berkson, 1944](https://doi.org/10.2307%2F2280041))
* Onset of disease or condition
* Employment status
* College enrollment
* Passing a course or completing a credential
* Provide a correct response to a test question
* ... 

Just like with linear regression, we often we want to relate these types of binary variables to predictors, such as medical history, family background, personal characteristics, etc. That is what logistic regression does. 

The main theme of this chapter is also an extension of the previous two chapters. We have seen a general strategy for how to deal with data that do not "fit" the assumptions of linear regression: 

1. Transform one or more variables so that the data *do* fit the assumptions linear regression. 
2. Run the analysis as usual.
3. Then work out the interpretation of results in terms of the original variable(s). 

We will see this basic approach again in this chapter. In fact, its kind of a general-purpose hack for quantitative research -- when you are faced with a problem you don't know how to deal with, turn it into something you do know how to deal with. Certainly this is not the most creative approach, but it has the advantage of letting us "port over" many of the tools we have developed in one context (regression with a continuous outcome) into a new context (regression with a binary outcome). 

In terms of statistical modeling, the move to binary outcome variables is a pretty big deal. Everything we have done up until now has focused on OLS regression, using the same basic principles we discussed in Chapters @sec-chap-2 and  @sec-chap-3. However, logistic regression takes us into the wider framework of *generalized linear models* (GLMs), which are estimated using maximum likelihood (ML) rather than OLS. Thus we will need to start at the "ground floor" to build up our knowledge of logistic regression, which then provides a stepping stone to GLMs, which can additionally handle other types of outcome variables (e.g., count data, ordered categorical data). 

Since we are starting with a new modeling approach, let's kick things off with a new example. 

## The CHD example {#sec-chd-example-10}

As a working example, we will use data contained in the file `CHD.RData` to explore the relationship between age in years ("age") and evidence (absence or presence) of coronary heart disease ("chd"). The data set contains 100 cases. Respondents' ages range from 20 to 69, while evidence of CHD is coded 0 when it is absent and 1 when it is present. A sample of 20 cases is shown  below. (Source: Applied Logistic Regression by David W. Hosmer and Stanley Lemeshow, 1989, John Wiley and Sons.) 

```{r, fig.align='center'}
load("CHD.RData")
attach(chd.data)
knitr::kable(list(chd.data[sample(1:100, 10),2:3],   
                  chd.data[sample(1:100, 10),2:3]), 
             row.names = F, 
             caption = "The CHD example")
```

If we regress CHD on age using linear regression, this is referred to as the "linear probability model." The diagnostic plots and summary output are below: 

```{r, fig-lpm, echo = F, fig.cap = "Linear probability model with CHD example", fig.align = 'center', fig.width = 12}
mod1 <- lm(chd ~ age, data = chd.data)
par(mfrow = c(1, 2))
plot(mod1, 1)
plot(mod1, 2)
summary(mod1)
```

**Before moving on, please take a moment to write down you conclusions (and rationale) about whether the assumptions of linear regression are met for these data.**

I'll note that researchers who have a strong preference for OLS methods (AKA economists) often approach binary outcomes using the linear probability model. As we can see, this approach violates all of the assumptions of linear regression, can lead to predicted probabilities outside of the range [0,1], produces incorrect standard errors for model parameters (need to use HC standard errors), and is, in a word, wrong. Yet, despite all this, it works pretty well in some situations and has the benefit of being easier to interpret than logistic regression. We will consider the situations in which the linear probability model is "close enough" at the end of the next section. 

## Logit & logistic functions {#sec-logit-10}

The general game plan for dealing with a binary outcome is to transform it into a different variable that is easier to work with, run the analysis, and then "reverse-transform" the model coefficients so that they are interpretable in terms of the original binary variable. This strategy should sound familiar from @sec-chap-8 -- it's the same overall approach we used for log-linear regression. Also in common with @sec-chap-8, we are going to use logs and exponents as the main workhorse for this approach (that is where the "log" in logistic comes from).

However, the overall strategy for transforming the $Y$ variable in logistic regression is a bit more complicated than the log-linear model. So, it is helpful to start wit an overall "roadmap".  

* Step 1 (from binary to probability). First, we are going to work with probabilities rather than the original binary variable. In terms of our example, we are going to shift focus from whether or not a person has CHD to the *probability* of a person having CHD. 

* Step 2 (from probability to logistic). The logistic function is widely-used model for probabilities. In terms of our example, we are going to use the logistic function to relate the probability of a person having CHD to their age. 

* Step 3 (from logistic to logit). The logistic function has a nice interpretation, but it is not a linear function of age. So, we are going to transform it into something that is linear in age, which will let us "port over" a lot of what we have learned about linear models. Actually, the reason we choose the logistic function as a model of probability is because this transform is relatively straightforward and can be "undone" afterwards when interpreting the model coefficients, just like with log-linear regression. The transformation two steps:

    * Step3A (probability to odds). First we transform the probability of having CHD into the *odds* of having CHD. If $p$ denotes probability then odds are just $p / (1-p)$. We will spend a while talking about how to interpret odds. 
    
    * Step 3B (odds to logit). Then we take the log of the odds, which is called the *logit*. The logit turns out to be a linear function of age, so we can model the relationship between age and the logit of CHD in a way that is very similar to regular linear regression. 

So, that's the overall approach to dealing with a binary variable in logistic regression. Clear as mud, right? Don't worry, we will walk through each step in the following subsections. If you find yourself getting lost in the details, it can be helpful to refer back to this overall strategy. In short, the overall game plan is: 

$$ \text{binary outcome} \rightarrow \text{probability} \rightarrow \text{logistic} \rightarrow \text{logit (log odds) }$$
  
Once we have all these concepts in play, we can start doing logistic regression.

### From binary to probability

The following table presents the example data in terms of the proportion of cases with CHD, broken down by age groups. The first column shows the age groups, the second shows the number of cases without CHD, the third shows the number of cases with CHD, and the last column shows the proportion of cases with CHD. 

```{r, fig-props, echo = T, fig.cap = "From a binary variable to proportions", fig.align = 'center'}
knitr::include_graphics("files/images/props.png")
```

Recall that a proportion is computed as the number of cases of interest over the total number of cases. In terms of the table above: 

$$ p(CHD = 1) = \frac{ N_1}{N_0 + N_1 } $$ {#eq-prob}

were $N_1$ denotes the number of cases with CDH, and $N_0$ is the number of cases without. 

The number $p(CHD = 1)$ can be interpreted in many ways, which leads to a lot of terminology here. 

* The **proportion** of cases in our sample with CHD.
* If we multiply by 100, it is the **percentage** of cases with CHD (i.e., cases per 100) in our sample.
* If we multiply by a number other than 100 (say 1000), it is the **rate** of CHD (e.g., cases per 1000) in our sample.
* Since a proportion is just the mean of binary variable, it is the **mean** or expected value of CHD in our sample.
* And finally, since proportions are one interpretation of probability, it is the **probability** of CHD in our sample. 

You might hear all of these terms (i.e., proportion, percentage, rate, mean, probability) used in connection with logistic regression. But, they are all just different ways of interpreting the rightmost column of @fig-props. I will try to make a point of using all of these terms so you get used to interpreting them in this context :)  

Another concept that will be useful for interpreting our data is *odds*. Odds are closely related to, but not the same as, probability. The figure below adds the odds of having CHD to Figure @fig-props. 

```{r, fig-odds, echo = T, fig.cap = "Proportions and odds", fig.align = 'center'}
knitr::include_graphics("files/images/odds.png")
```

As shown in the table, the odds are also a function of the two sample sizes, $N_1$ and $N_0$:

$$\text{odds}(CHD = 1) = \frac{N_1}{N_0}.$$ {#eq-odds}


Let's take a moment to compare the interpretation of probability versus odds. 

* The first row of the table tells us that the probability of having CHD in your 20's is "1 in 10". Loosely, this means that for every 10 people in their 20s, one of them will have CHD. 

* By contrast, the odds of having CHD in your twenties is "1 to 9". Roughly, this means that for every person in their twenties with CHD, there are nine without CHD. 

Clearly, probabilities and odds are just two different ways of packaging the same information. The following equations shows the relation between odds and probability (these are derived from Equations @eq-prob and @eq-odds using algebra)

$$
\begin{align}
p(CHD = 1) & = \frac{\text{odds}(CHD = 1)}{1 + \text{odds}(CHD = 1)} \\ \\
\text{odds}(CHD = 1) & = \frac{p(CHD = 1)}{1 - p(CHD = 1)} 
\end{align}
$$ {#eq-p2o}

We will see these relations again shortly. But, before moving on, let's get some more practice interpreting odds and probabilities using the data in @fig-odds. **Please write down your answers to the following questions and be prepared to share them in class. For each question provide a verbal interpretation of the numerical answer (e.g, odds of 2 to 1 means that for every two people with a trait, there is one without.) **

  1. What is the probability of a person in their 40s having CHD? 
  2. What are the odds of a person in their 40s having CHD? 
  3. What is the probability of someone in their 50s **not** having CHD? 
  4. What are the odds of someone in their 50s **not** having CHD? 
  5. What is probability of having CHD in your 40s, compared to your 30s? (e.g., is 3 times higher? 4 times higher?)
  6. What are the odds of having CHD in your 40s, compared to your 30s? 
  
The answers hidden below (use the Code button to reveal), but you won't learn anything if you don't try the question yourself first! 

```{r}
# 1. .39, so about 40% of people
# 2. 11/17, so for 11 people with CHD there are 17 without
# 3. 1 - .72 = .28, so about 28% of people 
# 4. (18/7)^-1 = 7/18, so 7 out ever 18 people
# 5. .39 / .19 ~= 2, so the probability of having CHD in your 40s is about 2 times higher than the probability of having CHD in your 30s. This is called a relative risk, or a risk ratio. 
#6. (11/17)/(5/22) ~= 2.8, so the odds of having CHD in your 40s is about 2.8 times higher than the odds of having CHD in your 30s. This is called an odds ratio. 
```

### From probability to logistic 

On thing you may have noted about the CHD data is that the proportion of cases with CHD increases with age. This relationship is shown visually in @fig-chd2.

```{r, fig-chd2, echo = T, fig.cap = "Proportion of cases with CHD as a function of age", fig.align = 'center'}

# Sample proportions
prop <- tapply(chd, catage, mean)

# Age categories
years <- unique(catage)*10

# Plot
plot(years, 
     prop, 
     type = "l", 
     lwd = 2, 
     col = "#4B9CD3", 
     ylab = "p(CHD =1)", 
     xlab = "Age categories")
```

Looking at the plot, we might suspect that the relationship between the probability of CHD and age is non-linear. In particular, we know that probabilities cannot take on values outside of the range $(0, 1)$, so the relationship is going to have to "flatten out" in the tails. For example, even if you are a baby, your probability of having CHD cannot be less than 0. And, even if you are centenarian, the probability can't be great than 1. 

Based on this reasoning, we know that the relationship between age and the rate of CHD should take on a sort of  "S-shaped" curve or "sigmoid". This S-shape is hinted at in @fig-chd2 but is not very clear. Some clearer examples are shown in @fig-sigmoids. 

```{r, fig-sigmoids, echo = T, fig.cap = "Examples of sigmoids", fig.align = 'center'}

# Logistic function
logistic <- function(x, a, b){exp(a*x + b) / (1 + exp(a*x + b))}

# Generate data
x <- seq(-5, 5, by = .1)

# Plots
plot(x, logistic(x, 1, 0), 
     type = "l", 
     lwd = 2, 
     col = 2, 
     ylab = "logistic")

points(x, logistic(x, .75, -1.5), 
       type = "l", 
       lwd = 2, 
       col = 3, 
       ylab = "logistic")

points(x, logistic(x, 1.5,- 1), 
       type = "l", 
       lwd = 2,
       col = 4, 
       ylab = "logistic")

points(x, logistic(x, 3, 2), 
       type = "l", 
       lwd = 2, 
       col = 5, 
       ylab = "logistic")
```

The mathematical equation used to create these S-shaped curves is called the logistic function, the namesake of logistic regression. All you need to take-away from @fig-sigmoids is that there is mathematical function that produces the kind of relations we are expecting between age (continuous) the the probability of having CHD (bounded to the interval $(0, 1)$). 

Returning to our example, we can see in @fig-chd3 that the logistic function provides a reasonable approximation for the relationship between the rate of CHD and age. 

```{r, fig-chd3, echo = T, fig.cap = "Proportion of cases with CHD, data versus logistic", fig.align = 'center'}
par(mfrow = c(1, 2))
plot(years, prop, type = "l", lwd = 2, col = "#4B9CD3", ylab = "p(CHD =1)", xlab = "Age categories")
plot(20:60, logistic(20:60, .12, -5.2), col = "#4B9CD3", ylab = "logistic", xlab = "Age in years")
```

One important thing to notice about @fig-chd3 is that the plot on the left required re-coding age into a categorical variable and computing the proportion of cases with CHD in each age category (see @fig-props). However, the logistic plot on the right did not require categorizing age. So, one advantage of using the logistic function is that we can model the probability of CHD as a function of age "directly", without having to categorize our predictor variables. 

The take home message of this section is that the logistic function is a nice way to model how a proportion depends on a continuous variable like age. Next, we'll talk about the math of the logistic function in a bit more detail. 


### Logistic to log odds (logit) 

The formula for the logistic function (i.e., the function that produced the curves in @fig-sigmoids is

$$p = \frac{\exp(x)}{1 + \exp(x)}.$$ {#eq-logistic}
 

This function maps the variable $x$ onto the interval $(0, 1)$. In @fig-chd3 we saw that the logistic function can provide a nice model for probabilities. We also saw that the logistic function is  non-linear function of $x$ (i.e., it is sigmoidal or S-shaped). 

However, a nice thing about the logistic function is that we can transform it into a linear function of $x$. Since we already know how to deal with linear functions (that is what this whole course has been about!), transforming the logistic into a linear function of $x$ will let us port over a lot of what we know about linear regression to situations in which the outcome variable is binary. (In fact, the real motivation for choosing the logistic function in the first place, rather than some other S-shaped curve.)

So, let's see how to get from our S-shaped logistic function of $x$ to a linear function of $x$. Algebra with @eq-logistic shows that we can re-express the logistic function in terms of the odds: 

$$\frac{p}{1- p} = \exp(x).$$ {#eq-exp-odds}


Note that Equations @eq-logistic and @eq-exp-odds directly parallel the two expressions in Equation @eq-p2o. The only difference is that, in the logistic model, the odds are represented as an exponential function of the variable $x$, which is what Equation @eq-exp-odds is telling us. 

In order to turn @eq-exp-odds into a linear function of $x$, all we need to do is get rid of the exponent. Do you remember how?? That's right, just take the log (see @sec-math-review-8): 

$$ \log\left(\frac{p}{1- p}\right) = x.$$ {#eq-logit}

This equation is telling us that the log of the odds is linear in $x$. The log-odds is also called the *logit*, which is short for "logistic unit." 

The relationship among the logistic, odds, and logit are summarized  in @fig-logit. 

```{r, fig-logit, echo = T, fig.cap = "Logistic, odds, and logit", fig.align = 'center'}
knitr::include_graphics("files/images/logit.png")
```

* The left-hand panel shows the logistic function. This is our "intuitive-but-nonlinear" model for probabilities. In terms of our example, this panel is saying that the probability of having CHD is a logistic or S-shaped function of age. 

* The middle panel shows that the odds are an exponential function of $x$. In terms of our example, this means that the odds of having CHD are an exponential function of age. This is the main assumption of the logistic model, and we will revisit this assumption again when we get to @sec-assumption-checking-10.  

* Finally, the right-hand panel shows the "not-really-intuitive-but-definitely-linear" model for the logit. In terms of our example, the logit of having CHD is a linear function of age. 

The next section discusses how to interpret the logit by reverse-transforming it back to the odds and probabilities. The situation is a lot like log-linear regression (@sec-chap-9). 

### Pop quiz 

Before moving, lets nail down the relation between probability, odds, and logits. @fig-logit-table) presents the relationship in tabular form. 

```{r, fig-logit-table, echo = F, fig.cap = "Logistic, odds, and logit", fig.align = 'center'}
knitr::include_graphics("files/images/logit-table.png")
```

**I will asks some questions along the following lines in class.**

  * If probability of an event is equal to .1, what are the odds the event? What is the logit of the event? 
  * If odds of an event are 4 to 1, what is the probability of the event? What is the logit of the event? 
  * If logit < 0 then probability <  ? and odds < ? 
  * What is more likely: a event with probability of .9 or an event with odds of .9? 
  * If a probability of $p$ corresponds to a  $\text{logit}$ of $x$, what is the logit corresponding to $1-p$? (Hint, try some numerical examples from the table). 
  

### Next steps 

The logit is our workhorse for logistic regression. In  @sec-simple-10, we will replace the variable $x$ with a simple regression model $a + bX$ to get simple logistic regression. In @sec-multiple-10 we will extend simple logistic regression to multiple logistic regression, just like we did for multiple linear regression. 

Although the logit is the workhorse, we generally don't want to work with the logit when it comes time to interpret the results. The situation here is a lot like log-linear regression (@sec-chap-9). In log-linear regression, we treated $\log(Y)$ as a linear function of our predictor variable(s). However, we didn't want to interpret the model in terms of $\log(Y)$, because, well, who thinks in log units? Instead we wanted an interpretation in terms of the original outcome, $Y$.

The same situation applies here. You may have already noted that the relationship between the logit (i.e., $\log(\text{odds})$) and $\text{odds}$ in logistic regression is the same as the relationship between $\log(Y)$ and $Y$ in log-linear regression. The parallel between the two model is as follows: 

* In the log-linear model we interpreted a $b$ unit increase in $\log(Y)$ in terms of an $(\exp(b) - 1) \times 100\%$ change in $Y$ (see Section @ref-interpretation-8)). 

* In logistic regression we will interpret a $b$ unit increase in $\text{logit}(Y)$ in terms of an $(\exp(b) - 1) \times 100\%$ times change in $\text{odds}(Y)$. 

So, while we use the logit function for modeling, we often use the odds for interpretation. One subtle difference to be aware of is that, in logistic regression, we usually report results in terms of relative magnitude (called the odds ratio) rather than relative change, although relative change is often used for verbal reporting. We will see examples in the next section.   

Some authors have argued that people don't really know how to interpret odds properly. These authors suggest that we interpret the logistic model in terms of probabilities, rather than odds. We will discuss how to do this as well.


### Summary

At this point we have covered the overall logic of how we can model a binary outcome variable like CHD in terms of the logistic function. The overall situation is very similar to, but a bit more complicated than, log-linear regression. The main take aways are

* We use the logit (log-odds) for statistical analysis, because it results in a linear function, and we already know how to deal with linear functions. 

* We use the odds for interpretation, because the logistic model leads to proportional change in the odds, in the same way that the log-linear model leads to proportional change in $Y$. 

* We can also use probabilities for interpretation, but, since the logistic model implies that probabilities are non-linear (sigmoidal), things can get a bit complicated with this approach. 

## Simple logistic regression {#sec-simple-10}

In this section we move onto logistic regression proper. For the CHD example, the model we are interested in is 

$$\text{logit}(CHD) = a + b (\text{AGE}). $$

We are going to skip a few steps and go right into the interpretation of the R output. Once we know how to interpret the output, we will loop back to discuss details of estimation and inference in the following sections. 

The summary R output for the example is below. The focus for now is just the interpretation of the values under the "Estimate" heading. 

```{r}
mod2 <- glm(chd ~ age, family = binomial, data = chd.data)
summary(mod2)
```

Plugging the estimates into our logit model, we have the following equation

$$ \text{logit}(CHD) = -5.31  + .11 (\text{age}). $$

The "literal" interpretation of this equation is: 

* When $\text{age} = 0$, $\text{logit}(CHD) = -5.31$.
* Each unit of increase in age (i.e., each additional year) is associated with a .11 unit increase in $\text{logit}(CHD)$. 

While this interpretation is perfectly correct, most applied audiences are not going to know how to interpret   $\text{logit}(CHD)$. So, instead, we often work with the odds and probabilities, as outlined in the next few sections. 

### Odds ratio

The logistic regression model implies

$$\frac{\text{odds} (X+1)}{\text{odds}(X)} = \exp(b)$$ {#eq-OR}

where $\text{odds}(X)$ are the odds of the outcome associated with a given value of the predictor $X$. Equation @eq-OR is called the *odds ratio* (abbreviated OR) associated with a one-unit increase in $X$. 

If you refer back to section @sec-derivation-8, you can see we are using the exact same approach from log-linear regression, but in @eq-OR we interpret the regression coefficient in term of the odds that $Y = 1$, rather than the $Y$ variable itself.  

For the CHD example, the OR is:

$$\exp(b) = \exp(.11) = 1.1163 $$

This means that each additional year of age is associated with an OR of 1.11. For example, the odds for someone aged 21 having CHD is 1.11 time larger (relative magnitude) that someone aged 20. The really useful thing about the OR is that it is constant over values of the predictor. So, regardless of whether we are comparing a 21-year-old to a 20-year-old, or 41-year-old to a 40-year-old, the OR is the same. 

Just like the log-linear model, we can also report the results of our analysis in terms of relative change rather than relative magnitude. In particular, the percent increase in the odds of CHD associated with each additional year of age is: 

$$(\exp(.11) - 1) \times 100 = 11.63\% $$

This means that the predicted odds of CHD increase 11.63% for each additional year of age. 

Whether you use relative magnitude (i.e., the odds ratio) or relative change (i.e., percent change in odds) to report the results of logistic regression is up to you. In many fields, it is conventional to reports the odds ratios in tables, but to use percent change when writing about results in a sentence.

Before moving, **please practice your interpretation of the OR in simple logistic regression using the following examples**

* If $b=0$ what is the OR equal to? What is the percent change in the odds for a one unit increase in $X$? 
* If $b=.25$ what is the OR equal to? What is the percent change in the odds for a one unit increase in $X$? 
* If $b=-.025$ what is the OR equal to? What is the percent change in the odds for a 10 unit increase in $X$? 
* If the odds increase 100% for a one unit increase in $X$, what $b$ equal to? 

Answers hidden below (use Code button), but please try out the questions yourself first! 

```{r}
# 1. OR = exp(0) = 1 and percent change equals (exp(0) - 1) X 100 = 0%. So, "no relationship" means OR = 1. 
# 2. OR = exp(.25) = 1.2840 and percent change equals (exp(.25) - 1) X 100 = 28.40% increase
# 3. OR = exp(-.025) = 0.9753 and percent change for one unit equals (exp(-.025) - 1) X 100 = (-.02469 X 100 -2.469%. For 10 units of change, multiply by 10, which gives 24.69% decrease (negative sign is decrease). 
# 4. (exp(b) - 1) X 100 = 100 --> exp(b) = 2 --> b = log(2) = .6931
```


### Other interpretations: Predicted probabilities

Another way to interpret the logistic model is in terms of the predicted probabilities, which are plotted below for the example data. 

```{r, fig-pred-prob, echo = T, fig.cap = "Predicted probabilities", fig.align = 'center'}
visreg::visreg(mod2, xvar = "age", scale = "response")
```

Using this plot, we can read off the probability of CHD for any given age. We might also want to report the probability of CHD for two or more chosen ages, which is an example of the MERV approach to marginal effects (see @sec-inference-for-interactions-5):  

```{r}
library(emmeans)
emmeans(mod2, specs = "age", at = list(age = c(20, 40)), type = "response")
```

The ratio of two probabilities is often called the *risk ratio* or the *relative risk*. So, we could also say that the risk ratio of CHD for someone who in their 40s as compared to someone who is 20 is .2947 / .0435 = 6.77. Otherwise stated, the risk of having CHD in you are 40s is almost 7 times higher than in your 20s (relative magnitude).

### Other interpretations: Equal odds

Another interpretation of logistic regression is to report the value of $X$ at which the $\text{odds}$ of the outcome are equal to 1 (equivalently, the probability of the outcome is equal to .5). This idea is illustrated in @fig-equal-odds. 

```{r, fig-equal-odds, echo = T, fig.cap = "The Equal Odds Interpretation", fig.align = 'center'}
x <- data.frame(age = 20:70)
prob <- predict(mod2, newdata = x, type = "response")
plot(x$age, prob, xlab = "age", ylab = "p(CHD)", type = "l", col = "#4B9CD3")
segments(x0 = 15, y0 = .5, x1 = 48, y1 = .5, lty = 2, lwd = 2)
segments(x0 = 48, y0 = 0, x1 = 48, y1 = .5, lty = 3, lwd = 2)
```

First we find the probability of .5 on the $Y$ axis and then follow the horizontal dashed line to the logistic curve. Then we follow the vertical dashed line down to the value of $X$. This gives use the age at which the probability of CHD is "50-50". Based on the plot we can say that, after your 48th birthday, your chances of having CHD are above 50%. 

The math behind this interpretation is below. Since

$$\log(.5/.5) = \log(1) = 0 $$

we can solve 

$$ a + b(\text{age}) = 0 $$

to find the age at which someone has equal odds of CHD, leading to

$$\text{age} = - a/b. $$

For the example data

$$ \text{age} = - a/b = - (-5.31) / .11 = 48.27, $$

which confirms the conclusion we made looking at the plot. 

In summary, another way of interpreting regression coefficients in simple logistic regression is to compute $-a / b$, which gives the value of $X$ at which $p(Y = 1) = .5$. 

### Other interpretations: Rate of change

Yet another interpretation is in terms of the slope of the straight line (tangent) through the point $p(CHD = 1) = .5$. The slope of this line describes the rate of change in the probability of CHD for people who are "close to" the age of equal odds (48 years in our example). The tangent line for our example is shown in @fig-tangent. 

```{r, fig-tangent, echo = T, fig.cap = "The Rate of Change Interpretation", fig.align = 'center'}
x <- data.frame(age = 20:70)
prob <- predict(mod2, newdata = x, type = "response")
plot(x$age, prob, xlab = "age", ylab = "p(CHD)", type = "l", col = "#4B9CD3")
abline(a = -.815, b = .11/4, lty = 2, lwd = 2)
```


It turns out that the slope of the tangent line is equal to exactly $b/4$. The derivation requires calculus and is omitted (ask in class if you are interested!). For the example data $b / 4 = .11 / 4 = .0275$. So, for every additional year, the predicted probability of CHD increases by .0275. Keep in mind, this interpretation only applies to people who "around" the age of equal odds  (48 years old in this example). Looking at the plot, we can see that this approximation is pretty good for people between the ages of 40 and 60. 

### Relation to linear probability model 

Notice that in our example, the logistic function is roughly linear for probabilities in the range $[.2, .8]$. As mentioned in the introduction of this chapter, this is the situation in which using linear regression with a binary outcome (i.e., the linear probability model) works "well enough". Also note that the regression coefficient from the linear probability model in @sec-chd-example-10 ($b_{OLS} = .0218$) is in the ballpark of the coefficient computed above ($b_{logistic} / 4 = .0275$). These numbers are both describing how the probability of CHD is related to a person's age. 

The logistic model also provides us with a way "diagnosing" whether the linear probability model is a good approximation. As noted, the logistic function is roughly linear for probabilities in the range $[.2, .8]$. If we ran a linear regression on CHD and none of the fitted / predicted values are outside the range $[.2, .8]$, we would be in the situation where we might prefer to use linear regression (despite it being technically wrong). Referring back to residual vs. plotted in @sec-chd-example-10, we can see that the predicted values were outside of this range, so the logistic model is the better way to approach for this example. 

### Summary 

The simple logistic regression model 

$$ \text{logit}(CHD) = a + b (\text{AGE}) $$

has the following interpretations. 

* In terms of the logit: 
    * The intercept ($a$) is the predicted value of the log-odds of CHD when age = 0. 
    * The slope ($b$) is how much the predicted log-odds of CHD changes for one unit (year) of increase in age.

* In terms of the odds: 
    * The exponent of the regression parameter, $\exp(b)$, is odds ratio associated with a one unit of increase in age (relative magnitude).
    * $(\exp(b) - 1) \times 100$ is the percentage change in the odds of CHD for a one unit increase in age (relative change). 
    * For the intercept, $\exp(a)$ is the predicted odds of having CHD when $age = 0$. This isn't a very useful number in our example, but it can be useful when the predictor(s) are centered.  

* In terms of predicted probabilities
    * The logistic plot provides a visual summary of how the probability of CHD changes as a function of age -- if you want to report in terms of probabilities, this plot is usually a good choice! 
    * Predicted probabilities can be reported for specific values of age (MERVs), and risk ratios / relative risk can be computed to compare the predicted probabilities at specific ages. This is the same approach we used for following-up interactions in @sec-inference-for-interactions-5 (i.e., you can use `emmeans` in R).
    * $–a / b$ corresponds the age at which the probability of having CHD is "50-50"
    * $b / 4$ is the approximate rate of increase (slope) of the probability of having CHD for people close to the "50-50" point.  

**Please write down the numerical values of each of the above summaries for the CHD example (except the predicted probability plot). You can select any values of age to report the predicted probabilities and risk ratios, and you can "eye ball" the probabilities using @fig-pred-prob.** 

Answers are hidden below (use the Code button), but please try them yourself first. 

```{r}
# Logit: 
# predicted logit when age = 0: a = -5.31;
# expected increase in logit when age increases by one year: b = .11

# Odds:
# OR = exp(b) = exp(.11) = 1.1163
# % change in Odds = (exp(b) - 1) X 100 = 11.63%

# Probability
# In the example, used risk for Age = 40 relative to Age = 20: .2947/.0435 = 6.77
# "50-50" age: -a/b = 5.31 / .11 = 48.27 
# Rate of change at "50-50" age: b/4 = .11/4 = .0275
```
