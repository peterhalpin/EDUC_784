Sections denoted with an asterisk (*) are optional.\nThe notes contain questions that are written in bold font. The questions are also collected in a section called “Workbook” that appears towards the end of each chapter. During class time, we will discuss the Workbook questions, your answers, any additional question you have, etc. It is really important for you to do the readings, and write down your responses to the questions, before class. You won’t get much out of the lessons if you haven’t done this preparation.\nSome chapters contain a section called “Exercises” that collects all of the R code from that chapter into a single overall workflow. You don’t need to do the Exercises before class, but you can if you want to. If a chapter doesn’t have an Exercises section, that means we will be working on an assignment together instead."

For example, instead of writing\n\\[ X_1 + X_2 + X_3 + .... + X_N\\]\nto represent the sum of the values of the variable \\(X\\) in a sample of size \\(N\\), we can instead write:\n\\[ \\sum_{i=1}^{N} X_i. \\]\nThe symbol \\(\\Sigma\\) means “add.” The symbol is called “Sigma” – it’s the capital Greek letter corresponding to the Latin letter “S”. The value \\(i\\) is called the index, and \\(1\\) is the starting value of the index and \\(N\\) is the end value of the index. You can choose whatever start and end values you want to sum over. For example, if we just want to add the second and third values of \\(X\\), we write\n\\[ \\sum_{i=2}^{3} X_i = X_2 + X_3. \\]\nWhen the start and end values are clear from context, we can use a shorthand notation that omits them. In the following, it is implicit that the sum is over all available values of \\(X\\) (i.e., from \\(1\\) to \\(N\\)):\n\\[ \\sum_i X_i. \\]"

    "text": "1.2 Rules of summation\nThere are rules for manipulating summation notation that are useful for deriving results in statistics. These rules are things you learned about addition in grade school, but they are presented using summation notation. You don’t need to do mathematical proofs or derivations in this class, but you will occasionally see some derivations in these notes (mainly in the optional sections).\nHere are the rules:\nRule 1: Sum of a constant (multiplication). Summing the values of a constant \\(c\\) is the same as multiplication. Specifically, if you add a constant \\(c\\) to itself \\(N\\) times, this just \\(N\\) times the constant:\n\\[\\begin{align}\n\\sum_{i = 1}^{N} c &= c + c +  .... \\\\\n& = Nc\n\\end{align}\\]\nRule 2: Distributive property. The sum of a variable \\(X_i\\) times a constant \\(c\\) is equal to the constant times the sum.\n\\[\\begin{align}\n\\sum_{i = 1}^{N} c X_i &= cX_1 + cX_2 + .... \\\\\n& = c(X_1 + X_2 + ....) \\\\\n& = c \\sum_{i = 1}^{N} X_i\n\\end{align}\\]\nRule 3: Associative property. It doesn’t matter what order we do addition in:\n\\[\\begin{align}\n\\sum_{i = 1}^{N} (X_i + Y_i) &= (X_1 + Y_1) + (X_2 + Y_2) + .... \\\\\n& = (X_1 + X_2 + ....) + (Y_1 + Y_2 + ....) \\\\\n& = \\sum_{i = 1}^{N} X_i  + \\sum_{i = 1}^{N} Y_i\n\\end{align}\\]"

    "text": "1.4 Properties of sample statistics\nThe following are some useful properties of the sample statistics reviewed above. The properties tell us what happens to means, variances, covariances, and correlations when a variable is linearly transformed. We often linearly transform data (e.g., to compute percentages, proportions, z-scores, and in linear regression), so these properties turn out to be quite handy.\nYou can derive the properties using the rules of summation. For each property, the beginning of the derivation is shown. You should know the properties but completing the derivations is optional.\nSum of deviations from the mean. If we subtract the mean from each data point, we have a deviation (or deviation score): \\(d_i = X_i - \\bar X\\). Deviation scores sum to zero: \\(\\sum_i d_i = 0\\).\n\nDerivation\n\n\\[ \\sum_i d_i = \\sum_i(X_i - \\bar X) = \\dots \\]\nMean of a linear transformation.

The z-score (or standardized score) is defined as \\(Z_i = (X_i - \\bar{X}) / \\text{SD}(X)\\). Standardized scores are useful because \\(\\bar{Z} = 0\\) and \\(\\text{var}(Z) = 1\\).\n\nDerivation: use the rules for linear transformation with \\(A = -\\bar{X} / \\text{SD}(X)\\) and \\(B = 1/ \\text{SD}(X)\\).\n\nCovariance of linear transformations.

    "section": "1.5 Bias and precision",
    "text": "1.5 Bias and precision\nIn this section we consider two more important properties of sample statistics. These properties are defined in terms of the sampling distribution of a statistic. Recall that a sampling distribution arises from the following thought experiment:\n\nTake a random sample of size \\(N\\) from a population of interest.\nCompute a statistic using the sample data. It can be any statistic, but let’s say the mean, \\(\\bar X\\), for concreteness.\nWrite down the value of the mean, and then return the sample to the population.\n\nAfter doing these 3 steps many times, you will have many values the sample mean,\n\\[ \\bar{X}_1, \\bar{X}_2, \\bar{X}_3, \\bar{X}_4, \\bar{X}_5, ... \\]\nThe distribution of these sample means is called a sampling distribution.\nA sampling distribution is just like any other distribution – so it has its own mean, and its own variance, etc. These statistics, when computed for a sampling distribution, have special names. We are especially interested in:\n\nThe expected value of the mean, denoted \\(E(\\bar X)\\), is the mean of the sampling distribution of the mean. That is a mouthful! That is why we say the “expected value” or “expectation” of a statistic rather than the mean of a statistic. It’s called the expected value because it’s the average value over many samples.\nThe standard error of the mean, denoted \\(SE(\\bar X)\\), is the standard deviation of the sampling distribution of the mean. It describes the sample-to-sample variation of the mean around its expected value.\n\nNow for the two additional properties of sample statistics:\n\nBias: If the expected value of a statistic is equal to a population parameter, we say that the statistic is an unbiased estimate of that parameter. For example, the expected value of the sample mean is equal to the population mean (in symbols: \\(E(\\bar{X}) = \\mu)\\), so we say that the sample mean is an unbiased estimate of the population mean.\nPrecision: The inverse of the squared standard error (i.e., \\(1 / \\text{SE}(\\bar{X})^2\\)) is called the precision of a statistic. So, the less a statistic varies from sample to sample, the more precise it is. That should hopefully make intuitive sense. The main thing to know about precision is that it is usually increasing in the sample size – i.e., we get more precise estimates by using larger samples. Again, this should feel intuitive.\n\nBelow is a figure that is often used to illustrate the ideas of bias and precision. The middle of the concentric circles represent the target parameter (like a bull’s eye) and the dots represent the sampling distribution of a statistic. You should be able to describe each panel in terms of the bias and precision of the statistic.\n\n\n\nFigure 1.1: Bias and Precision"

    "section": "1.6 t-tests",
    "text": "1.6 t-tests\nThe \\(t\\)-test is used to make an inference about the value of an unknown population parameter. The test compares the value of an unbiased estimate of the parameter to a hypothesized value of the parameter. The conceptual formula for a \\(t\\)-test is\n\\[ t = \\frac{\\text{unbiased estimate} - \\text{hypothesized value }}{\\text{standard error}} \\]\nWhen we conduct a \\(t\\)-test, the basic rationale is as follows: “if the estimate is close the hypothesized value of the parameter, then the numerator should be small relative to the standard error, and so \\(t\\) should be close to zero.”\nTypically, the hypothesized value of the population parameter is equal to zero, in which case it is called a null hypothesis. The null hypothesis usually translates into a research hypothesis of “no effect” or “no relationship.” So, if \\(t\\) is close to zero, it means there was no effect.\nIn order to determine what values of \\(t\\) are “close to zero”, we refer to its sampling distribution, which is called the \\(t\\)-distribution. The \\(t\\)-distribution tells what values of \\(t\\) are typical if the null hypothesis is true. (More specifically: if the sample statistic is normally distributed and its expected value is equal to the hypothesized value of the parameter, then \\(t\\) has a “central” \\(t\\)-distribution.)\nSome examples of the \\(t\\)-distribution are shown below. The x-axis denotes values of the statistic \\(t\\) shown above, and \\(\\nu\\) is a parameter called the “degrees of freedom” (more on this below). You can see that the \\(t\\)-distribution looks like a normal distribution centered a zero. So, when the null hypothesis is true, the expected value of \\(t\\) is zero. Informally, we could say that values greater than \\(\\pm 2\\) are pretty unlikely, and values greater than \\(\\pm 4\\) are very unlikely. Keep in the mind that these are the values of \\(t\\) we are expecting if the null hypothesis is true.\n\n\n\nFigure 1.2: t-distribution (source: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Student%27s_t-distribution)\n\n\nMore formally, we can compare the value of \\(t\\) computed in a sample, denoted as \\(t_{\\text{obs}}\\), to a “critical value”, denoted as \\(t^*\\). The critical value is chosen so that the “significance level”, defined as \\(\\alpha = \\text{Prob}(|t| \\geq t^*)\\), is sufficiently small.\nThe significance level is chosen by the researcher. It represents our tolerance for false positives or Type I Errors – i.e., incorrectly rejecting the null hypothesis, or incorrectly concluding there is an effect when there isn’t one. When we set \\(\\alpha\\) to a small number, we are saying that we want the probability of a false positive to be small. This means we are going to need strong evidence before we reject the null hypothesis – i.e., the value of \\(t\\) would need to be very unlikely under the null hypothesis.\nThere are two equivalent ways of “formally” conducting a \\(t\\)-test.\n\nCompare the observed value of \\(t\\) to the critical value. Specifically: if \\(|t_{\\text{obs}}| &gt; t^*\\), reject the null hypothesis.\nCompare the significance level chosen by the researcher, \\(\\alpha\\), to the “p-value” of the test, computed as \\(p = \\text{Prob}(|t| \\geq |t_{\\text{obs}}|)\\). Specifically: if \\(p &lt; \\alpha\\), reject the null hypothesis.\n\nInformally, both of these just mean that the absolute value of \\(t\\) should be pretty big (i.e., greater than \\(t^*\\)) before we reject the null hypothesis.\nOne last thing before moving on: the t-distribution has a single parameter called its “degrees of freedom”, which is denoted as \\(\\nu\\) in Figure 1.2. The degrees of freedom are always an increasing function of the sample size, with larger samples leading to more degrees of freedom. When the degrees of freedom approach \\(\\infty\\), the \\(t\\)-distribution approaches a normal distribution. This means that the difference between a \\(t\\)-test and a \\(z\\)-test is pretty minor in large samples (say \\(N \\geq 100\\)).\nHowever, when the degrees of freedom are small, the \\(t\\)-distribution has wider tails than the normal distribution. This is also shown in Figure 1.2. The tails of the distribution are important when doing statistical tests, because we are interested knowing about large / unlikely values of \\(t\\). So, in small samples (say \\(N &lt; 100\\)), it is important to use the \\(t\\)-distribution rather than the normal distribution."

    "text": "1.7 Confidence intervals\nA confidence interval uses the same equation as a \\(t\\)-test, except we solve for the population parameter rather than the value of \\(t\\). Whereas a \\(t\\)-test lets us make a guess about specific value of the parameter of interest (i.e., the null-hypothesized value), a confidence interval gives us a range of values that include the parameter of interest, with some degree of “confidence.”\nConfidence intervals have the general formula:\n\\[\\text{Interval} = \\text{unbiased estimate} \\pm t \\times {\\text{standard error}}. \\] We get the value of \\(t\\) from the \\(t\\)-distribution. In particular, if we want the interval to include the true population parameter \\((1-\\alpha) \\times 100\\%\\) of the time, then we choose \\(t\\) to be the \\(\\alpha/2 \\times 100\\) percentile of the \\(t\\)-distribution. For example, if we set \\(\\alpha = .05\\), we will have a \\((1-\\alpha) \\times 100 = 95\\%\\) confidence interval by choosing \\(t\\) to be the \\(\\alpha/2 \\times 100 = 2.5\\)-th percentile of the \\(t\\)-distribution.\nAs mentioned, \\(t\\)-tests and confidence intervals are closely related. In particular, if the confidence interval includes the value \\(0\\), this is the same as retaining the null hypothesis that the parameter is equal to \\(0\\). This should make intuitive sense. If the confidence interval includes \\(0\\), we are saying that it is a reasonable value of the population parameter, so we should not reject that value. This equivalence between tests and confidence intervals assumes we use the same level of \\(\\alpha\\) for both of them.\nIn summary, if the confidence interval includes zero, we retain the null hypothesis at the stated level of \\(\\alpha\\). If the confidence interval does not include zero, we reject the null hypothesis at the stated level of \\(\\alpha\\)."

    "text": "1.8 F-tests\nThe \\(F\\)-test is used to infer if two independent variances have the same expected value. This turns out to be useful when we analyze the variance of a variable into different sources (i.e., Analysis of Variance or ANOVA).\nA variance can be defined as a sum-of-squares divided by its degrees of freedom. For example, the sample variance is just a sum-of-squared deviations from the sample mean (a sum of squares) divided by \\(N - 1\\) (its degrees of freedom).\nThe generic formula for an F-test is the ratio of two variances:\n\\[F = \\frac{SS_A / df_A}{SS_B / df_B}, \\]\nwhere \\(SS\\) denotes sums-of-squares and \\(df\\) denotes degrees of freedom.\nJust the like \\(t\\)-test, the \\(F\\)-test is called by the letter “F” because it has an \\(F\\)-distribution when the null hypothesis is true (i.e., when the variances have the same expected value). The plot below shows some examples of \\(F\\)- distributions. These distributions tell us the values of \\(F\\) that are likely, if the null hypothesis is true.\n\n\n\nFigure 1.3: F-distribution (source: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/F-distribution)\n\n\nThe F distribution has two parameters, which are referred to as the “degrees of freedom in the numerator” and the “degrees of freedom in the denominator” (in the figure, d1 and d2, respectively). We always write the numerator \\(df\\) first and then the denominator \\(df\\). So, the green line in the figure is “an \\(F\\)-distribution on 10 and 1 degrees of freedom”, which means the \\(df\\) in the numerator is 10 and the \\(df\\) in the denominator is 1.\nWe use an \\(F\\)-test the same way we use a \\(t\\)-test – we set a significance level and use this level to determine how large the value of \\(F\\) needs to be for us to reject the null hypothesis. The main difference is that \\(F\\) is non-negative, because it is the ratio of squared numbers. We don’t usually compute confidence intervals for statistics with an \\(F\\)-distribution."

You don’t need to do it before class.\nIf you are already familiar with R, please skim through the content and work on getting the NELS data loaded. If you are not familiar with R, or would like to brush up your R skills, you should work through this section.\n\n1.10.1 General info about R\nSome things to know about R before getting started:\n\nR is case sensitive. It matters if you useCAPS or lowercase in your code.\nEach new R command should begin on its own line.\nUnlike many other programming languages, R commands do not need to end with punctuation (e.g., ; or .).\nR uses the hash tag symbol (#) for comments. Comments are ignored by R but can be helpful for yourself and others to understand what your code does. An example is below.\n\n\n# This is a comment. R doesn't read it.\n# Below is a code snippet. R will read it and return the result. \n2 + 2\n\n[1] 4\n\n\n\nR’s working memory is cumulative. This means that you have to run code in order, one line after the next. It also means that any code you run is still hanging around in R’s memory until you clear it away using rm or the brush icon in R Studio - make sure to ask about how to do this in class if you aren’t sure.\n\n\n\n1.10.2 The basics\nAs we have just seen, R can do basic math like a calculator. Some more examples are presented in the code snippets below. R’s main math symbols are\n\n+ addition\n- subtraction or negative numbers\n* multiplication\n/ division (don’t use \\)\n^ or ** exponentiation\n\n\n2 * 2\n\n[1] 4\n\n\n\n# Remember pedmas? Make sure to use parentheses \"()\", \n# not brackets \"[]\" or braces \"{}\"\n(2 - 3) * 4 / 5 \n\n[1] -0.8\n\n\n\n# Exponentiation can be done two ways\n2^3\n\n[1] 8\n\n2**3\n\n[1] 8\n\n\n\n# Square roots are \"squirt\". Again, make sure to use \"()\", \n# not brackets \"[]\" or braces \"{}\"\nsqrt(25)\n\n[1] 5\n\n\n\n# Logs and exponents, base e (2.718282....) by default \nlog(100)\n\n[1] 4.60517\n\nexp(1)\n\n[1] 2.718282\n\n\n\n# We can override the default log by using the \"base\" option\nlog(100, base = 2)\n\n[1] 6.643856\n\n\n\n# Special numbers...\npi \n\n[1] 3.141593\n\n\n\n\n1.10.3 The help function\nThe help function is your best friend when using R. If we want more info on how to use an R function (like log), type:\n\nhelp(log)\n\nIf you don’t exactly remember the name of the function, using ??log will open a more complete menu of options.\n\n\n1.10.4 Logicals and strings\nR can also work with logical symbols that evaluate to TRUE or FALSE. R’s main logical symbols are\n\n== is equal to\n!= is not equal to\n&gt; greater than\n&lt; less than\n&gt;= greater than or equal to\n&lt;= less than or equal to\n\nHere are some examples:\n\n2 + 2 == 4\n\n[1] TRUE\n\n\n\n2 + 2 == 5\n\n[1] FALSE\n\n\n\n2 + 3 &gt; 5\n\n[1] FALSE\n\n\n\n2 + 3 &gt;= 5\n\n[1] TRUE\n\n\nThe main thing to note is that the logical operators return TRUE or FALSE as their output, not numbers. There are also symbols for logical conjunction (&) and disjunction (|), but we won’t get to those until later.\nIn addition to numbers and logicals, R can work with text (also called “strings”). We wont use strings a lot but they are worth knowing about.\n\n\"This is a string in R. The quotation marks tell R the input is text.\"\n\n[1] \"This is a string in R. The quotation marks tell R the input is text.\"\n\n\n\n\n1.10.5 Assignment (naming)\nOften we want to save the result of a calculation so that we can use it later on. In R, this means we need to assign the result a name. Once we assign the result a name, we can use that name to refer to the result, without having to re-do the calculation that produced the result. For example:\n\nx &lt;- 2 + 2\n\nNow we have given the result of 2 + 2 the name “x” using the assignment operator, &lt;-.\nNote that R no longer prints the result of the calculation to the console. If we want to see the result, we can type x\n\n# To see the result a name refers to, just type the name\nx \n\n[1] 4\n\n\nWe can also do assignment with the = operator.\n\ny = 2 + 2\ny\n\n[1] 4\n\n\nIt’s important to note that the = operator also gets used in other ways (e.g., to override default values in functions like log). Also, the math interpretation of “=” doesn’t really capture what is happening with assignment in computer code. In the above code, we are not saying that “2 + 2 equals y.” Instead, we are saying, “2 + 2 equals 4 and I want to refer to 4 later with the name ‘y’.”\nAlmost anything in R can be given a name and thereby saved in memory for later use. Assignment will become a lot more important when we name things like datasets, so that we can use the data for other things later on.\nA few other side notes:\n\nNames cannot include spaces or start with numbers. If you want separate words in a name, consider using a period ., an underscore _, or CamelCaseNotation.\nYou can’t use the same name twice. If you use a name, and then later on re-assign that same name to a different result, the name will now only represent the new result. The old result will no longer have a name, it will be lost in the computer’s memory and will be cleaned up by R’s garbage collector. Because R’s memory is cumulative, it’s important to keep track of names to make sure you know what’s what.\nR has some names that are reserved for built-in stuff, like log and exp and pi. You can override those names, but R will give a warning. If you override the name, this means you can’t use the built-in functions until you delete that name (e.g., rm(x)).\n\n\n\n1.10.6 Pop-quiz\n\nIn words, describe what the following R commands do.\n\nx &lt;- 7\nx = 7\nx == 7\n7 -&gt; x\n7 &gt; x\n\nAnswers: Check the commands in R.\n\n\n\n1.10.7 Vectors\nIn research settings, we often want to work with multiple numbers at once (surprise!). R has many data types or “objects” for doing this, for example, vectors, matrices, arrays, data.frames, and lists. We will start by looking at vectors.\nHere is an example vector, containing the sequence of integers from 15 to 25.\n\n# A vector containing the sequence of integers from 15 to 25\ny &lt;- 15:25\ny\n\n [1] 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25\n\n\nWhen we work with a vector of numbers, sometimes we only want to access a subset of them. To access elements of a vector we use the square bracket notation []. Here are some examples of how to index a vector with R:\n\n# Print the first element of the vector y\n# Note: use brackets \"[]\" not parens\"()\"\ny[1]\n\n[1] 15\n\n\n\n# The first 3 elements\ny[1:3]\n\n[1] 15 16 17\n\n\n\n# The last 5\ny[6:11]\n\n[1] 20 21 22 23 24 25\n\n\nWe can also access elements of a vector that satisfy a given logical condition.\n\n# Print the elements of the vector y that are greater than the value 22\ny[y &gt; 22]\n\n[1] 23 24 25\n\n\nThis trick often comes in handy so its worth understanding how it works. First let’s look again at what y is, and what the logical statement y &gt; 22 evaluates to:\n\n# This is the vector y\ny\n\n [1] 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25\n\n# This is the logical expression y &gt; 22\ny &gt; 22\n\n [1] FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE  TRUE  TRUE  TRUE\n\n\nWe can see that y &gt; 22 evaluates to TRUE or FALSE depending on whether the correspond number in the vector y is greater than 22. When we use the logical vector as an index – R will then return all the values for which y &gt; 22 is TRUE.\nIn general, we can index a vector y with any logical vector of the same length as y. The result will return only the values for which the logical vector is TRUE.\n\n\n1.10.8 Computing sample stats\nThe following are examples of statistical operations you can do with vectors of numbers. These examples follow closely to Section 1.1 to Section 1.4\n\n# Making a vector with the \"c\" command (combine) \nx &lt;- c(10, 9, 15, 15, 20, 17)\n\n# Find out how long a vector is (i.e., the sample size)\nlength(x)\n\n[1] 6\n\n# Add up the elements of a vector\nsum(x)\n\n[1] 86\n\n# Add up the elements of a subset of a vector\nsum(x[2:3])\n\n[1] 24\n\n# Check the distributive rule\nsum(x*2) == sum(x) * 2 \n\n[1] TRUE\n\n# Check the associative rule\ny &lt;- c(5, 11, 11, 19, 13, 15)\nsum(x) + sum(y) == sum(x + y) \n\n[1] TRUE\n\n# Compute the mean\nmean(x)\n\n[1] 14.33333\n\n# Compute the variance\nvar(x)\n\n[1] 17.46667\n\n# Compute the standard deviation\nsd(x)\n\n[1] 4.179314\n\n# Compute the covariance\ncov(x, y)\n\n[1] 10.66667\n\n# Compute the correlation\ncor(x, y)\n\n[1] 0.5457986\n\n\n\n\n1.10.9 Working with datasets\nMost of the time, we will be reading-in data from an external source. The easiest way to do this is if the data is in the .RData file format. Then we can just double-click the .Rdata file and Rstudio will open the file, or we can use the load command in the console – both do the same thing.\nTo get started, let’s load the NELS data. The data are a subsample of the 1988 National Educational Longitudinal Survey (NELS; see https://nces.ed.gov/surveys/nels88/).\nThis data and codebook are available on the Canvas site of the course under “Files/Data/NELS” and are linked in the “Module” for Week 1. You need to download the data onto your machine and then open the data file (e.g., by clicking it, or double-clicking, or whatever you do to open files on your computer). That will do the same thing as the following line of code\n\n#This is what happens when you double-click NELS.RData\nload(\"NELS.RData\")\n\nThe function dim reports the number of rows (500 persons) and columns (48 variables) for the data set.\n\ndim(NELS)\n\n[1] 500  48\n\n\nIf you want to look at the data in a spreadsheet, use the following command. It won’t render anything in this book, but you can see what it does in R. (You may need to install XQuartz from https://www.xquartz.org if you are using a Mac.)\n\nView(NELS)\n\nIf you want to edit the data set using the spreadsheet, use edit(NELS). However, R’s spreadsheet editor is pretty wimpy, so if you want to edit data in spreadsheet format, use Excel or something.\nWorking with data is often made easier by “attaching”” the dataset. When a dataset it attached, this means that we can refer to the columns of the dataset by their names.\n\n# Attach the data set\nattach(NELS)\n\n# Print the first 10 values of the NELS gender variable\ngender[1:10]\n\n [1] Male   Female Male   Female Male   Female Female Female Female Male  \nLevels: Female Male\n\n\nWarning about attaching datasets. Once you attach a dataset, all of the column names in that dataset enter R’s working memory. If the column names in your dataset were already used, the old names are overwritten. If you attach the same dataset more than once in the same session, R will print a warning telling you that the previously named objects have been “masked” – this won’t affect your analyses, but it can be irritating.\nThe basic point: we should only attach each dataset once per R session. Once you are done using a data set it is good practice to detach it:\n\ndetach(NELS)\n\n\n\n1.10.10 Preview of next week\nFigure 1.4 shows the relationship between Grade 8 Math Achievement (percent correct on a math test) and Socioeconomic Status (SES; a composite measure on a scale from 0-35). Once you have reproduced this figure, you are ready to start the next chapter.\n\n# Load and attach the NELS data\nload(\"NELS.RData\")\nattach(NELS)\n\n# Scatter plot\nplot(x = ses, \n     y = achmat08, \n     col = \"#4B9CD3\", \n     ylab = \"Math Achievement (Grade 8)\", \n     xlab = \"SES\")\n\n# Run a simple linear regression \nmod &lt;- lm(achmat08 ~ ses)\n\n# Add the regression line to the plot\nabline(mod)\n\n# Detach the data set\ndetach(NELS)\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.4: Math Achievement and SES (NELS88)."

The difference \\(e = Y - \\widehat Y\\) is called a residual. The residuals for a subset of the data points in Figure @ref(fig:fig1) are shown in pink in Figure @ref(fig:fig2)\n\n\nCode\n# Get predicted values from regression model\nyhat &lt;- mod$fitted.values\n\n# select a subset of the data\nset.seed(10)\nindex &lt;- sample.int(500, 30)\n\n# plot again\nplot(x = ses[index], y = achmat08[index], ylab = \"Math Achievement (Grade 8)\", xlab = \"SES\")\nabline(mod)\n\n# Add pink lines\nsegments(x0 = ses[index], y0 = yhat[index] , x1 = ses[index], y1 = achmat08[index], col = 6, lty = 3)\n\n# Overwrite dots to make it look at bit better\npoints(x = ses[index], y = achmat08[index], col = \"#4B9CD3\", pch = 16)\n\n\n\n\n\nResiduals for a Subsample of the Example.\n\n\n\n\nNotice that \\(Y = \\widehat Y + e\\) by definition. So, we can use either Equation @ref(eq:yhat) or the equation below to write out a regression model:\n\\[\\begin{align}\nY = a + bX + e.  \n(\\#eq:y)\n\\end{align}\\]\nBoth equations say the same thing, but Equation @ref(eq:y) lets us talk about the values of \\(Y\\) in the data, not just the predicted values.\nAnother way to write out the model is using the variable names (or abbreviations) in place of the more generic “X, Y” notation. For example,\n\\[\\begin{align}\n\\widehat {MATH} = a + b(SES).\n(\\#eq:read)\n\\end{align}\\]\nThis notation is more informative about the specific variables in the example. But it is also more clunky and doesn’t lend itself to other mathematical expressions. For example, \\(r_{XY}\\) is much clearer than \\(r_{SES, MATH}\\) – in general, we want most of the text on the “baseline”, not the subscripts or superscripts.\nYou should be familiar with all 3 ways of presenting regression equations and you are free to use whatever approach you like best in your own writing."

    "text": "2.3 OLS\nIntuitively, one approach to “fitting a line to the data” is to select the parameters of the line (its slope and intercept) to minimize the residuals. In ordinary least squares (OLS) regression, we minimize a related quantity, the sum of squared residuals:\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\nSS_{\\text{res}} & = \\sum_{i=1}^{N} e_i^2 \\\\\n& = \\sum_{i=1}^{N} (Y_i - a - b X_i)^2\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nwhere \\(i = 1 \\dots N\\) indexes the respondents in the sample. OLS regression is very widely used and is the main focus of this course, although we will visit some other approaches in the second half of the course.\nSolving the minimization problem (setting derivatives to zero) gives the following equations for the regression parameters:\n\\[\na = \\bar Y - b \\bar X \\quad \\quad \\quad \\quad b = \\frac{\\text{Cov}(X, Y)}{s^2_X} = r_{XY} \\frac{s_Y}{s_X}\n\\]\n(If you aren’t familiar with the symbols in these equations, check out the review materials in Section @ref(review-2) for a refresher.)\nFor the NELS example, the regression intercept and slope are, respectively:\n\n\nCode\ncoef(mod)\n\n\n(Intercept)         ses \n    48.6780      0.4293 \n\n\nPlease write down an interpretation of these numbers in terms of the line in Figure @ref(fig:fig1), and be prepared to share your answers in class!\n\n2.3.1 Correlation and regression\nNote that if \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\) are transformed to z-scores (i.e., to have mean of zero and variance of one), then\n\n\\(a = 0\\)\n\\(b = \\text{Cov}(X, Y) = r_{XY}\\)\n\n(You can check these results by plugging the value 0 for the means and the value 1 for the variance in the equations above.)\nSo, regression, correlation, and covariance are all very closely related when we consider only two variables at a time. This is why we didn’t make a big deal about simple regression in EDUC 710 – its basically just the same thing as correlation. But, when we get to multiple regression (i.e., more than one \\(X\\) variable), we will see that relationship between regression and correlation (and covariance) gets more complicated."

    "text": "2.4 R-squared\nIn the previous section we saw that the predicted value of Math Achievement increased by .43 units (about half a percentage point) for each unit of increase in SES. Another way to interpret this relationship is in terms of the proportion of variance in Math Achievement that is associated with SES – i.e., to what extent are individual differences in Math Achievement associated with, or explained by, individual differences in SES?\nThis question is represented graphically in Figure @ref(fig:rsquared). The horizontal line denotes the mean of Math Achievement. The difference between the indicated student’s Math Achievement score and the mean can be divided into two parts.\n\nThe black dashed line shows how much closer we get to the student’s Math Achievement score (\\(Y\\)) by considering the predicted values (\\(\\widehat Y\\)) instead of the overall mean (\\(\\bar Y\\)). This represents the extent to which this student’s Math Achievement is explained by the linear relationship with SES.\nThe pink dashed line is the regression residual, which was introduced in Section @ref(regression-line-2). This is the variation in Math Achievement that is “left over” after considering the linear relationship with SES.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Idea Behind R-squared.\n\n\n\n\nThe R-squared statistic averages the variation in Math Achievement associated with SES (i.e., the black dashed line) relative to the total variation in Math Achievement (i.e., black + pink) for all students in the sample. R-squared is a widely used statistic in regression analysis, so we will be seeing it a lot. Some authors call it the “coefficient of determination” instead of R-squared.\nUsing all of the cases from the example (Figure @ref(fig:fig1)), the R-squared statistic is:\n\n\nCode\noptions(digits = 5)\nsummary(mod)$r.squared\n\n\n[1] 0.10128\n\n\nPlease write down an interpretation of this number and be prepared to share your answer in class.\n\n2.4.1 Derivation*\nTo derive the R-squared statistic we work the numerator of the variance, which is called the total sum of squares.\n\\[SS_{\\text{total}} = \\sum_{i = 1}^N (Y_i - \\bar Y)^2. \\]\nIt can be re-written using the predicted values \\(\\widehat Y\\):\n\\[SS_{\\text{total}} = \\sum_{i = 1}^N [(Y_i - \\widehat Y_i) + (\\widehat Y_i - \\bar Y)]^2. \\]\nThe right hand side can be reduced to two other sums of squares using the rules of summation algebra (see the review in Section @ref(review-2)):\n\\[\\begin{align}\nSS_{\\text{total}} & = \\sum_{i = 1}^N (Y_i - \\widehat Y_i)^2 + \\sum_{i = 1}^N (\\widehat Y_i - \\bar Y)^2 \\\\\n\\end{align}\\]\nThe first part is just \\(SS_\\text{res}\\) from Section @ref(ols-2). The second part is called the regression sum of squares and denoted \\(SS_\\text{reg}\\). Using this terminology we can re-write the above equation as\n\\[ SS_{\\text{total}} = SS_\\text{res} + SS_\\text{reg} \\]\nThe R-squared statistic is\n\\[R^2 = SS_{\\text{reg}} / SS_{\\text{total}}. \\]\nAs discussed above, this is interpreted as the proportion of variance in \\(Y\\) that is explained by its linear relationship with \\(X\\)."

We want to be able to draw conclusions about that population based on the sample of eighth graders that participated in NELS. In order to do that, we make some statistical assumptions about the population, which are collectively referred to as the population model. We talk about how to check the plausibility of these assumptions in Chapter @ref(chapter-8).\nThe regression population model has the following three assumptions, which are also depicted in the diagram below.

So, unless you have a hypothesis or research question about this particular value of \\(X\\) (e.g., eighth graders with \\(SES = 0\\)), you won’t be interested in this test (even though R always provides it).\nWhen we get to multiple regression, we will see some examples of regression models where the intercept is meaningful, especially when we talk about categorical predictors in Chapter @ref(chapter-5) and interactions in Chapter @ref(chapter-6). But, for now, we can put it on the back burner."

    "text": "2.9 Inference for R-squared\nInference for R-squared is quite a bit different than for the regression parameters. As we saw in section @ref(rsquared-2), R-squared is a ratio of two sums of squares. We know from our study of ANOVA last semester that ratios of sums of squares are tested using an F-test, rather than a t-test. The F-test for (the population) R-squared is summarized below.\n\n2.9.1 F-tests\nThe null hypothesis \\(H_0: R^2 = 0\\) can be tested against the alternative \\(H_A: R^2 \\neq 0\\) using the test statistic:\n\\[ F = (N-2) \\frac{\\widehat R^2}{1-\\widehat R^2} \\]\nwhich has a F-distribution on \\(1\\) and \\(N – 2\\) degrees of freedom when the null is true. The test assumes that the population model is true. Confidence intervals for R-squared are generally not reported.\nThe R output from Section @ref(inference-for-slope-2) is presented again below.

    "section": "2.10 Power analysis",
    "text": "2.10 Power analysis\nStatistical power is the probability of rejecting the null hypothesis, when it is indeed false. Rejecting the null hypothesis when it is false is sometimes called a “true positive”, meaning we have correctly inferred that a parameter of interest is not zero. Power analysis is useful for designing studies so that the statistical power / true positive rate is satisfactory. In practice, this comes down to having a large enough sample size.\nPower analysis in regression is very similar to power analysis for the tests we studied last semester. There are four ingredients that go into a power analysis:\n\nThe desired Type I Error rate, \\(\\alpha\\).\nThe desired level of statistical power.\nThe sample size, \\(N\\).\nThe effect size, which for regression is Cohen’s f-squared statistic (AKA the signal to noise ratio):\n\n\\[ f^2 = {\\frac{R^2}{1-R^2}}. \\]\nIn principal, we can plug-in values for any three of these ingredients and then solve for the fourth. But, as mentioned, power analysis is most useful when we solve for \\(N\\) while planning a study. When solving for \\(N\\) “prospectively,” the effect size \\(f^2\\) should be based on reports of R-squared in past research. Power and \\(\\alpha\\) are usually chosen to be .8 and .05, respectively.\nWhen doing secondary data analysis (as in this class) there is not much point in solving for the sample size, since we already have the data. Instead, we can solve for the effect size. In the NELS example we have \\(N=500\\) observations. The output below reports the smallest effect size we can detect with a power of .8 and \\(\\alpha = .05\\). This is sometimes called the “minimum detectable effect size” (MDES). Note that the output \\(u\\) and \\(v\\) denote the degrees of freedom in the numerator and denominator of the F-test of R-squared, respectively.\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(pwr)\npwr.f2.test(u = 1, v = 498, sig.level = .05, power = .8)\n\n\n\n     Multiple regression power calculation \n\n              u = 1\n              v = 498\n             f2 = 0.015754\n      sig.level = 0.05\n          power = 0.8\n\n\nWhat is the MDES for the NELS example?

    "text": "2.12 Exercises\nThese exercises collect all of the R input used in this chapter into a single step-by-step analysis. It explains how the R input works, and provides some additional exercises. We will go through this material in class together, so you don’t need to work on it before class (but you can if you want.)\n\n2.12.1 The lm function\nThe functionlm, short for “linear model”, is used to estimate linear regressions using OLS. It also provides a lot of useful output.\nThe main argument that the user provides to the lm function is a formula. For the simple regression of Y on X, a formula has the syntax:\nY ~ X\nHere Y denotes the outcome variable and X is the predictor variable. The tilde ~ just means “equals”, but the equals sign = is already used to assign values in R, so ~ is used in its place when writing a formula. We will see more complicated formulas as we go through the course. For more information on R’s formula syntax, see help(formula).\nLet’s take a closer look using the following two variables from the NELS data.\n\nachmat08: eighth grade math achievement (percent correct on a math test)\nses: a composite measure of socio-economic status, on a scale from 0-35\n\n\n\nCode\n# Load the data. Note that you can click on the .RData file and RStudio will load it\n# load(\"NELS.RData\") #Un-comment this line to run\n\n# Attach the data: will dicuss this in class\n# attach(NELS) #Un-comment this line to run!\n\n# Scatter plot of math achievment against SES\nplot(x = ses, y = achmat08, col = \"#4B9CD3\")\n\n# Regress math achievement on SES; save output as \"mod\"\nmod &lt;- lm(achmat08 ~ ses)\n\n# Add the regression line to the plot\nabline(mod)\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\n# Print out the regression coefficients\ncoef(mod)\n\n\n(Intercept)         ses \n   48.67803     0.42926 \n\n\nLet’s do some quick calculations to check that the lm output corresponds the formulas for the slope and intercept in Section @ref(ols-2):\n\\[ a = \\bar Y - b \\bar X \\quad \\text{and} \\quad b = \\frac{\\text{Cov}(X, Y)}{s_X^2} \\] We won’t usually do these kind of “manual” calculations, but it is a good way consolidate knowledge presented in the readings with the output presented by R. It is also useful to refresh our memory about some useful R functions and how the R language works.\n\n\nCode\n# Confirm that the slope from lm is equal to the covariance divided by the variance of X\ncov_xy &lt;- cov(achmat08, ses)\ns_x &lt;- var(ses)\nb &lt;- cov_xy / s_x\nb\n\n\n[1] 0.42926\n\n\nCode\n# Confirm that the y-intercept is obtained from the two means and the slope\nxbar &lt;- mean(ses)\nybar &lt;- mean(achmat08)\n\na &lt;- ybar - b * xbar\na\n\n\n[1] 48.678\n\n\nLet’s also check our interpretation of the parameters. If the answers to these questions are not clear, please make sure to ask in class!\n\nWhat is the predicted value of achmat08 when ses is equal to zero?\nHow much does the predicted value of achmat08 increase for each unit of increase in ses?\n\n\n\n2.12.2 Variance explained\nAbove we found out that the regression coefficient was 0.4-ish. Another way to describe the relationships is by considering the amount of variation in \\(Y\\) that is associated with (or explained by) its relationship with \\(X\\). Recall that one way to do this is via the variance decomposition\n\\[ SS_{\\text{total}} = SS_{\\text{res}} + SS_{\\text{reg}}\\]\nfrom which we can compute the proportion of variation in Y that is associated with the regression model\n\\[R^2 = \\frac{SS_{\\text{reg}}}{SS_{\\text{total}}}\\]\nThe R-squared for the example is presented in the output below. You should be able to provide an interpretation of this number, so if it’s not clear make sure to ask in class!\n\n\nCode\n# R-squared from the example\nsummary(mod)$r.squared\n\n\n[1] 0.10128\n\n\nAs above, let’s compute \\(R^2\\) “by hand” for our example.\n\n\nCode\n# Compute the sums of squares\nybar &lt;- mean(achmat08)\nss_total &lt;- sum((achmat08 - ybar)^2)\nss_reg &lt;- sum((yhat - ybar)^2)\nss_res &lt;-  sum((achmat08 - yhat)^2)\n\n# Check that SS_total = SS_reg + SS_res\nss_total\n\n\n[1] 43527\n\n\nCode\nss_reg + ss_res\n\n\n[1] 43527\n\n\nCode\n# Compute R-squared\nss_reg/ss_total\n\n\n[1] 0.10128\n\n\nCode\n# Check that R-squared is really equal to the square of the PPMC\ncor(achmat08, ses)^2\n\n\n[1] 0.10128\n\n\n\n\n2.12.3 Predicted values and residuals\nThe lm function also returns the residuals \\(e_i\\) and the predicted values \\(\\widehat{Y_i}\\), which we can access using the $ operator. These are useful for various reasons, especially model diagnostics which we discuss later in the course. For now, lets just take a look at the residual vs fitted plot to illustrate the code.\n\n\nCode\nyhat &lt;- mod$fitted.values\nres &lt;- mod$resid\n\nplot(yhat, res, col = \"#4B9CD3\")\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\ncor(yhat, res)\n\n\n[1] -2.9515e-16\n\n\nNote that the predicted values are uncorrelated with the residuals – this is always the case in OLS.\n\n\n2.12.4 Inference\nNext let’s talk about statistical inference, or how we can make conclusions about a population based on a sample from that population.\nWe can use the summary function to test the coefficients in our model.\n\n\nCode\nsummary(mod)\n\n\n\nCall:\nlm(formula = achmat08 ~ ses)\n\nResiduals:\n    Min      1Q  Median      3Q     Max \n-20.600  -6.552  -0.148   6.023  27.663 \n\nCoefficients:\n            Estimate Std. Error t value Pr(&gt;|t|)    \n(Intercept)  48.6780     1.1282   43.15  &lt; 2e-16 ***\nses           0.4293     0.0573    7.49  3.1e-13 ***\n---\nSignif. codes:  0 '***' 0.001 '**' 0.01 '*' 0.05 '.' 0.1 ' ' 1\n\nResidual standard error: 8.86 on 498 degrees of freedom\nMultiple R-squared:  0.101, Adjusted R-squared:  0.0995 \nF-statistic: 56.1 on 1 and 498 DF,  p-value: 3.13e-13\n\n\nIn the table, the t-test and p-values are for the null hypothesis that the corresponding coefficient is zero in the population. We can see that the intercept and slope are both significantly different from zero at the .05 level. However, the test of the intercept is not very meaningful (why?).\nThe text below the table summarizes the output for R-squared, including its F-test, it’s degrees of freedom, and the p-value. (We will talk about adjusted R-square in Chapter 4)\nWe can also use the confint function to obtain confidence intervals for the regression coefficients. Use help to find out more about the confint function.\n\n\nCode\nconfint(mod)\n\n\n               2.5 %   97.5 %\n(Intercept) 46.46146 50.89461\nses          0.31668  0.54184\n\n\nBe sure to remember the correct interpretation of confidence intervals: there is a 95% chance that the interval includes the true parameter value (not: there is a 95% chance that the parameter falls in the interval). For example, there is a 95% chance that the interval [.31, .54] includes the true regression coefficient for SES.\n\n\n2.12.5 Power analysis\nPower analyses should ideally be done before the data are collected. Since this class will work with secondary data analyses, most of our analyses will be retrospective. But don’t let this mislead you about the importance of statistical power – you should always do a power analysis before collecting data!!\nTo do a power analsyis in R, we can install and load the pwr package. If you haven’t installed an R package before, it’s pretty straight forward – but just ask the instructor or a fellow student if you run into any issues.\n\n\nCode\n# Install the package \ninstall.packages(\"pwr\")\n\n\n\n\nCode\n# Load the package by using the library command\nlibrary(\"pwr\")\n\n\n\n\nCode\n# Use the help menu to see what the package does\nhelp(\"pwr-package\")\n\n\nTo do a power analysis for linear regression, it is common to use Cohen’s \\(f^2\\) as the effect size:\n\\[f^2 = \\frac{R^2}{1-R^2}.\\]\nRecall that \\(R^2\\) is the proportion of variance in \\(Y\\) explained by the model, and so \\(1 - R^2\\) is the proportion of variance not explained by the model. Thus, \\(f^2\\) can be interpreted as a signal to noise ratio.\nIn addition to the effect size, we need to know the degrees of freedom for the F-test of R-square. The pwr functions use the following notation:\n\nu is the degrees of freedom in the numerator of an F-test.\nv is the degrees of freedom in the denominator of an F-test.\n\nIn simple regression, u = 1 and v = N - 2.\nAs an example of (prospective) power analysis, let’s find out many observations would be required to detect an effet size of R-square = .1, using \\(\\alpha = .05\\) and power = .8. To find the answer, enter the provided information into the pwr.f2.test function, and the function will solve for the “missing piece” – in this case \\(v = N - 2\\).\n\n\nCode\n# Use the provided values of R2, alpha, power (and u = 1) to solve for v = N - 2\nR2 &lt;- .1\nf2 &lt;- R2/(1-R2)\npwr.f2.test(u = 1, f2 = f2, sig.level = .05, power = .8)\n\n\n\n     Multiple regression power calculation \n\n              u = 1\n              v = 70.611\n             f2 = 0.11111\n      sig.level = 0.05\n          power = 0.8\n\n\nIn this example we find that \\(v = 70.6\\). Since \\(v = N - 2\\), so we know that a sample size of \\(N = 72.6\\) (rounded up to 73) is required to reject the null hypothesis that \\(R^2 = 0\\), when the true population value is \\(R^2 = .1\\), with a power of .8 and using a significance level of .05.\n\n\n2.12.6 Additional exercises\nIf time permits, we will address these additional exercises in class.\nThese exercises replace achmat08 with\n\nachrdg08: eighth grade Reading Achievement (percent correct on a reading test)\n\nPlease answer the following questions using R.\n\nPlot achrdg08 against ses. Is there any evidence of nonlinearity in the relationship?\nWhat is the correlation between achrdg08 and ses? How does it compare to the correlation with Math and SES?\nHow much variation in Reading is explained by SES? Is this more or less than for Math? Is the proportion of variance explained significant at the .05 level?\nHow much do predicted Reading scores increase for a one unit of increase in SES? Is this a statistically significant at the .05 level?\nWhat are your overall conclusions about the relationship between Academic Achievement and SES in the NELS data?"
